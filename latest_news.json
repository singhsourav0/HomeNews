        "article_text": "The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned.\nAid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut.\nIt is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected.\nThe conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023.\nThe kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods.\n\"People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\"\nThe Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID.\nThe State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice.\nThe normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance \u2013 on which the communal kitchens depend \u2013 will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes.\nThe closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations.\nThe network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID.\nIt's a \"huge setback\" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who's set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms.\nThe former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN.\nMoney had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works.\n\"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets (humanitarian group) in Syria.\"\nFor Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out.\nThere was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege.\nMost of the kitchens have closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon \"we expect to see a lot of people starving\".\nHere and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID.\n\"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],\" she said, \"but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was.\"\n\"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,\" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation.\nThey are \"exhausted, traumatised and underfunded\" and \"we were scaling up to help them\".\nThe State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful.\n\"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\" it said in response to a BBC query.\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances.\nIn 2024 the United States was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan.\nTop UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries.\n\"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,\" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month.\nThe influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further.\n\"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,\" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director.\nHe had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. \"We are strained. It's extremely difficult.\"\nThey both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, \"it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger\", says Ms Dagesh.\nMost families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority.\n\"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,\" she said.\nMost of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people.\nThey say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing.\nFaced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape.\nMany of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods.\nThey would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight.\nWith the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders.\nYet aid agencies that normally would help are strained. \nThe UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise \"to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum\".\nIt does not help that the agency was already underfunded. \nThe UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut \"everything\", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive.\nThe US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo. \n\"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,\" Mr Balde told the BBC.\nFaced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on \"very dangerous journeys\", says Mr Balde.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government. \u00a0\n\"Wes Streeting is entitled to shape things as he wishes\", said one, \"but the role of NHS England chief executive will change\".\nThe reality is that whoever is appointed, the government faces huge challenges cutting waiting lists for operations and treatments, and reducing long waits in emergency departments.\nNHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.\nMs Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.\nHe said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"\nRichard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.\n\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.\nMs Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.\nThe public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.\nMPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.\nLast week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"\nNHS England has announced that Sir James Mackey, currently chief executive of Newcastle Hospitals, will be taking over as interim head of NHS England and will work closely with Ms Pritchard for the next month before taking up post formally in April.\nHer successor, Sir James, said he was honoured to be leading the health service through the next phase \"as we radically reshape the role of NHS England and work with the government to build an NHS that is fit for the future through the 10-year health plan\".",

        "article_text": "Support for Ukraine has become a key issue since Donald Trump returned to the White House.\nPresident Trump has made a number of claims about how much the United States has spent compared to European countries.\nBut some of his claims are questionable - with no evidence to back them up.\nPresident Trump has made this claim on a number of occasions - including when he hosted France's President Macron in the White House this week.\nShort answer: Figures suggest the actual spend is much lower.\nBBC Verify can find no evidence to back up the claim.  There are different calculations on US spending in or related to Ukraine - and they produce a much lower figure.\nThe Kiel Institute is a German-based think tank tracking support going into Ukraine.  It calculated that the United States spent $119.7bn (\u00a394.3bn) on aid between January 2022 and December 2024.\nOthers have reached a higher figure - but with a broader definition of what counts as spending on Ukraine.\nThe US Department of Defense has provided a figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIt says $182.8bn has been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.\nEither way, both figures are considerably lower than claimed by the president.\nWe asked the White House about the basis for the $350bn claim. So far, it hasn't provided an explanation.\nPresident Trump has claimed: \"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference\"\nShort answer: Figures suggest Europe has spent more when all aid is included and, as above, we can't find any evidence for the $300bn figure.\nThe United States is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.\nThe figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nThey calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine. In the same period, the United States spent $119.7bn, according to their figures.\nNATO secretary general Mark Rutte made a similar argument, adding Canada into his calculation.\nMr Rutte said February 2025: \"In 2024, NATO Allies provided over 50 billion euros in security assistance to Ukraine \u2013 nearly 60% of this coming from Europe and Canada.\"\nWe asked for NATO's figures, but they said they were classified.\nThis is a claim President Trump made when he hosted President Macron. It prompted President Macron to disagree, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.\nShort answer: The EU has provided loans, but also grants. \nPresident Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures.

Like the United States Department of Defence, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.\nEU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.\nWhat we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been a mixture of loans and grants.\nThe UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine.\nThe only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.\nBut the UK contributions are much smaller than the United States.\nThat raises a question for the UK and other European countries; if the United States withdraws a large part of its funding to Ukraine, can other states make up the difference?\nThat would require a significant increase in their contributions.\n\nAdditional reporting: Thomas Spencer and Tamara Kovacevic\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.\nThe energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.\nBP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).\nThe move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.\nMurray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".\nHe said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.\nHe said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.\nHelge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.\nShares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.\nBP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.\nThe firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.\nMr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.\nIn 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.\nHowever, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.\nLast week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables. \nThe environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".\nAlexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".\nGlobal Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.\nSir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.\n\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said. \nChallenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.\nShe said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,\n\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told a committee of MPs.\n\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"\nThe decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.\nBP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.\nFive years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.\nBut in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%. \nIn the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.\nIn contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.\nBP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.  \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "summary": "BP shuns renewables in return to oil and gas 1 hour agoSimon Jack and Faarea MasudBusiness editor and business reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesBP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policyBP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharplyBP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs'Science hasn't changed'Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables. Global Witness'Not just down to one company'Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work. \"The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.

        "article_text": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.\nMy mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia \u2013 in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia.\nLike many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics \u2013 the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar.\nSynaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around\u00a060 different types of synaesthesia\u00a0have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types\u00a0experienced in clusters.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures\u00a0might conjure\u00a0emotions.\nSynaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and \u2013 although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental\u00a0and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia \u2013 it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial.\n\"When I was younger\u00a0I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch.\nFrisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical\u2013gustatory synaesthesia \u2013 where words have taste \u2013 explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation\u00a0when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic\u00a0blast.\"\nThis explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much \u2013 that I lost focus.\"\nIt wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange \u2013 and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch.\u00a0\"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\"\nFrisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages\u00a0fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\"\nFrisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".\nJulia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says.\nThe study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without \u2013 skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\".\n\"Specifically, they were significantly better in\u00a0receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\"\nHaving synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\"\nIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.\nThe researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".\nThey then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages.\n\"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' \u2013 or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language\u00a0even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\"\nThe results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn.\nWhen synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense \u2013 for example, both aurally\u00a0and\u00a0visually \u2013 their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern.\nTake 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word \u2013 but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages.\nYou might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool.\nSynaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\"\nHowever, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult \u2013 and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How synaesthesia inspires artists\n\u2022 The AI that 'tastes' colours\n\u2022\u00a0The adventure of raising bilingual children\n\"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes \u2013 the smallest unit of spoken meaning \u2013 evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red.\n\"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours.\nThis double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\"\u00a0explains Bouvet.\nWhether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\"\u00a0\nFor me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n--\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Dmitri Nabokov wrote Wednesday Is Indigo Blue.

        "article_text": "A dramatic day of high stakes diplomacy at the United Nations has exposed growing cracks in the transatlantic alliance since President Donald Trump returned to the global stage and massively shifted US foreign policy.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, Europe had no stronger partner than the United States.\nBut this week, in the halls of the General Assembly and at the Security Council, the US worked against its closest allies and sided with Russia, Belarus and North Korea to pass resolutions on the conflict in Ukraine.\nTo mark the third anniversary of Moscow's invasion, Ukraine sought a symbolic General Assembly resolution that would require the 193-member body to reaffirm Kyiv's territorial integrity and call for Russia to withdraw its forces in line with the UN charter.\nThat resolution did pass on Monday, but with less support than in past years. Many members abstained to avoid a tricky tension created by the US.\nWashington's diplomats had urged other countries to vote against the measure and to instead support their \"forward looking resolution\" that was only three short paragraphs. It took a neutral stance on the war, without blaming Russia, and called for a swift end with a lasting peace to follow.\nWashington not only introduced their measure in the General Assembly where every nation's vote is equal, but also in the more powerful Security Council. Resolutions there are legally binding - though sometimes hard to enforce - and there had never been council action on Ukraine because of Russia's veto power as a permanent member.\nThe move caught Europe off guard. One European diplomat told the BBC that the US behaved like a bully and did not take into account their stance on their continent's security.\nAnother who sits on the Security Council, Slovenia's ambassador Samuel Zbogar, told the BBC that Europe is struggling to adjust to the 180-degree change in the US position - and the speed at which Washington is moving.\nHe said the European Union will need to do some reflecting at the body's council meeting next week.\n\"Leaders will have to develop a plan on how the EU can actively be involved in finding peace, rather than reacting to what others are doing. It's up to us now in Europe to come forward,\" he told the BBC.\nThere were plenty of reactions in the halls of UN headquarters in New York, as European leaders worked to reconcile with the latest US position.\nThe UK's ambassador, Dame Barbara Woodward, and French UN Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere attempted to have the Security Council vote postponed, arguing that council members needed more time to consider the text and negotiate.\nInterestingly, the Chinese were willing to give more time for discussions, but the US and Russia, who are usually on opposite sides of issues on the council, both were against postponement.\nEuropean members of the council then tried to introduce amendments, as they had successfully done earlier in the General Assembly resolution which led to the US abstaining on its own resolution.\nIn the Security Council, the US threatened to block the proposed amendments to name Russia as the aggressor, reaffirm Ukraine's borders and call for a just peace. They said that it detracted from what Washington was trying to achieve and pursued a war of words rather than an end to the conflict.\nIn the end, the US didn't have to use its veto because Russia voted to block the amended language.\nThe US's neutral resolution then ultimately passed, breaking through three years of Security Council paralysis on the topic of Ukraine because of Russia's veto power.\nJust months ago, it would have seemed unthinkable that the first resolution adopted regarding the conflict would be one with such limited language - let alone that a resolution like this would be proposed by the US, condoned by Russia and passed without the full support of Europe's five council members.\nBut the US hailed the development, the first action by the council to call for an end to the war. Others were not so celebratory.\nRichard Gowan, UN Director of the Crisis Group, said after three years of deepening animosity between Russia and the US at the UN, the sight of the two powers coordinating to embarrass Europe was pretty stunning.\nHe said while everyone expected President Trump to be disruptive at the UN, this went beyond most people's expectations.\n\"The US lobbying against the European-Ukrainian resolution was very crude. US officials were reportedly threatening to cut aid to non-compliant states. This has left a nasty taste among many UN members,\" Mr Gowan said.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

Six Nations Rugby Special analyse Scotland's errors\nDespite Scotland outscoring England in tries, Russell failed to make any of his three conversion attempts count.\nMeanwhile, England full-back Marcus Smith was successful with all three of his kicks and his namesake Fin Smith nailed an important penalty from halfway with 10 minutes remaining.\nVan der Merwe's late try in the corner gave Russell the opportunity to extend Scotland's winning run over England to five games.\n\"It was a difficult kick from the touchline and he will be ruing the two earlier in the game which were much easier kicks,\" former Scotland hooker Fraser Brown told BBC'S Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"To go nil from three is not why Scotland lost but as an international 10, Finn will be really disappointed.\"\nRussell only missed one kick in the Six Nations last year, but this campaign - and in a British and Irish Lions year - is kicking at 38%.\nFormer England wing Ugo Monye told BBC's Six Nations Rugby Special that Van der Merwe had to do more to get closer to the posts when crossing for Scotland's third try.\n\"Van der Merwe is running away from the sticks on an outside angle,\" Monye said.\n\"You can see by his reaction that he does not look like he is celebrating scoring the winning try.\n\"When you look at the margins of how far he has run out against how much it has been missed by, he has to do more.\n\"As winger you have to do everything to try and help out.\"\n'Missed opportunities haunt Scotland on rough day'\nThis video can not be played\nFrance crush Italy with 11-try win\nWhen the 2025 Six Nations fixtures were first released one fixture stood out - Ireland v France in round four.\n\"Right when the fixtures came out, you thought that game is going to decide who wins the title,\" Warburton said.\nBoth sides have finished in the top two spots over the past three championships and played out one of the great Six Nations fixtures in 2023.\nBilled as a possible Grand Slam decider, Ireland have done their part with three straight wins as they seek an unprecedented third title in a row.\nFrance's last-gasp defeat by England prevented a potential Slam decider, but their 11-try thrashing of Italy gives Les Bleus momentum heading to Dublin on 8 March.\nFrance, with a superior points difference, are three points behind Ireland, making the fixture a potential Six Nations decider.\nWarburton when asked for his prediction went for an Ireland win, Barclay went the other way with France.\nFabien Galthie's side host Scotland in the final round, while Ireland travel to Italy, while England are also still in the title hunt.\nThis video can not be played\nWales played 'beyond themselves' in Ireland defeat - Bowe\nWhen Warren Gatland left his role as Wales boss, interim head coach Matt Sherratt only had three training sessions to try to produce one of the greatest shocks in Six Nations history.\nFacing Grand Slam-chasing Ireland in Cardiff, Wales were inches away from potentially taking the lead in the 73rd minute when Ellis Mee nearly pulled off a miracle finish.\nThe boot of 22-year-old fly-half Sam Prendergast helped Ireland close out the game 27-18.\nWhile Wales ended up falling to a 15th successive Test defeat, the performance of Sherratt's side succeeded expectations.\nFollowing a disappointing loss to Italy in round two, Sherratt made eight changes to his squad, which included bringing in Gloucester pair Gareth Anscombe and Max Llewellyn.\nWarburton believes Sherratt's changes in personnel and style brought big improvements.\n\"The nine-10-12-13 combination have all worked and played together under Sherratt, and are the best players for their position,\" Warburton added.\n\"He freshened the boys up, so they were full of beans for the game and he imprinted, so quickly and impressively, his attacking game plan, which was night and day from what we've seen the last 12 months.\n\"I can't believe he made so many positive changes within one week.\"\nWelsh rugby aims to recover heart and soul\nNo permanent ambition for Wales interim Sherratt \nIrish aim to 'press on' after surviving Wales scare\nThis video can not be played\nSix Nations Rugby Special: How 'superb' Ireland turned it around\nThis video can not be played\n'It's all about player safety' -

In my view, and a lot of other people, that should be a straight red card.\"\nWarburton says players' behaviours have not changed enough since he retired in 2018.\n\"There needs to be a much firmer punishment on individuals off the field,\" he said. \"If Ringrose gets a one or two-week ban then he is going to do that again.\n\"A four-week ban and he probably doesn't do that tackle again.

The changes are due to go into effect on 4 March. \n\"We're simplifying our menu to focus on fewer, more popular items, executed with excellence,\" the company said on Monday.\n\"This will make way for innovation, help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company.\"\nThe job cuts announced on Monday are focused on corporate \"support partner\" roles and will not affect jobs or investments at stores, the company said. \nThe company said it would inform staff affected by the decisions by mid-day on Tuesday. It is also eliminating \"several hundred\" open and unfilled positions. \n\"Our intent is to operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration,\" Mr Niccol wrote in the announcement. \nStarbucks employs more than 360,000 people and operates or licenses more than 40,000 stores around the world. \nThe US is its biggest and most important market, but its brand there has suffered in recent years as customers complained about long wait times and high prices, and the company wrestled with baristas trying to unionise. \nThe company was also embroiled in debates over the Israel-Gaza war, facing boycott calls from both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine camps, despite the company's efforts to remain neutral. \nThe company last month said transactions at US stores open at least a year were down 8% in the most recent quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier.\nThe drive to simplify the menu marks a shift from previous strategies, which emphasised personalised drinks.

        "article_text": "Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed.\nIsrael said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including \"humiliating\" handover ceremonies.\nA senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to \"grave danger\" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel.\nThe deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that the ceasefire was \"precarious\" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. \nHe also called for the \"dignified release of all remaining hostages\".\nOn Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages.\nAs with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel.\nLater, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a \"sickening display of cruelty\".\nThere was already fury in Israel after Hamas  returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.\nIt emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day.\nIsraeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys \"with their bare hands\", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike.\nIsrael was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails.\nThey had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers.\nIn the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed \"in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes\".\n\"It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies.\"\nHamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a \"blatant violation\" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released.\n\"We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,\" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday.\nAsked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that \"all options are on the table\".\n\"Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],\" he added.\n\"Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war.

        "article_text": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of J\u00f8rn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023.\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it \u2013 the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\u00a0\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018.\nThe judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\u00a0\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A\u00a33.5m or A$7m \u2013 at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 \u2013 the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\u00a0\nBut this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A\u00a312.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\nThe project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors \u2013 the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\u00a0\nUtzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\u00a0\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (\u00a351m).\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The first ever video game console\n\u2022\u00a0How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe\n\u2022\u00a0How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (\u00a333m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him.\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAs a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Bj\u00f6rk\u00a0and Massive Attack. In 1980,\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger\u00a0won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.In 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of J\u00f8rn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House.

When you are doing the changes if you have a football team who are playing well and winning games, it is easier for the fans and everyone to feel that. But in this moment we are in a difficult period inside of the club and inside of the pitch. We have to fight against this feeling.\n\"We have do our job and we try our best to help the team to perform better.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'I feel sorry for Rasmus Hojlund' - Troy Deeney\nUnited have scored 30 goals from 26 league games so far this season, with Rasmus Hojlund managing just two from 15 league starts.\nThe 22-year-old Denmark striker, who was signed from Atalanta for \u00a372 in August 2023, has scored seven goals in all competitions, with his last strike coming in the Europa League against Viktoria Plzen on 12 December.\n\"I think it's clear, we as a team, we are not helping Rasmus,\" Amorim added. \"We don't create a lot of chances.\n\"I think Rasmus has a lot of potential. If we improve the way we play the game, he will have more opportunities to score.\n\"He came here very young and, when you are very young, to be the number nine and play all the time sometimes is hard.\n\"We have to look at Rasmus as a player: he has the pace, he has the technique, he scores some goals that are really hard to score.\n\"Sometimes he doesn't choose the better runs, sometimes he's so anxious to touch the ball because he passes long minutes without the ball and he moves away from the goal.\n\"We address that in training.

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has said he will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions may decline the invitation. \n\"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\"\nThe Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media report.\nRumours of the Eagles declining an invitation to the White House created a firestorm on social media after a weeks-old report from The US Sun resurfaced online.\nThe Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 earlier this month, securing the team's second Super Bowl.\nSports teams visiting the White House after winning a championship is a tradition that dates back to the 19th Century, but in the past decades some have used it to make a statement.\nOnly one of the four teams that won the Super Bowl during Trump's first term in office made a trip to the White House. That was the New England Patriots in 2017. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles did not go to the White House after their victory in 2018.\nThe president said at the time that the players disagreed with his view \"that they proudly stand for the national anthem\", although the team or players never confirmed that as the reason. \nInstead, Trump invited a group of Eagles fans to a \"celebration of the American flag\".\nIn 2017, NBA champions the Golden State Warriors were uninvited from the White House event by Trump after star player Stephen Curry said he did not want to go. The Warriors were not invited when they won the NBA Championship again in 2018. \nThere were, however, some memorable sporting visits to the White House under Trump.

Ireland overcame Wales in Cardiff and England squeezed past Scotland at Allianz Stadium.\nBBC's Rugby Union Weekly pundits have had their say on who Lions head coach Andy Farrell will be keeping his eye on.\nFormer Lions captain Sam Warburton also gives his thoughts on who should be the squad's captain.\nPick your Lions XV in the comments section below.\nThe Calcutta Cup  - a fixture Scotland fly-half Finn Russell has lit up in recent years - was seen as a perfect opportunity for the two-time Lion to restate his credentials as the starting fly-half.\nRussell, especially in the opening half, looked back to his old self as he helped pick apart England's defence with his wide passing game.\nHowever, Gregor Townsend's side failed to capitalise on their dominance and came up short 16-15, with Russell missing all three kicks he had at goal - including a last-gasp match-winning conversion from the corner.\nDespite kicking at 38% in this year's Six Nations, former Scotland captain John Barclay is not concerned and still backs 32-year-old Russell to start.\n\"I still think Finn Russell [is in pole position],\" Barclay told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"I am not bothered about his kicking. His kicking last year and across the season for Bath has been great. He is a good kicker.\n\"It was the best he has played in the championship. Look at how he got Scotland's backline moving with his passing game. And his kicking game was good too.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'Russell's goal kicking massively disappointing so far'\nEngland fly-half Fin Smith backed up his player-of-the-match performance in round two with another assured display.\nThe Northampton Saint is 10 years younger than Russell and stepped up to kick a pressure penalty from halfway to continue his bid for a spot as one of Farrell's fly-halves.\nIreland fly-half Sam Prendergast, who recently turned 22, is the least experienced contender and won only his sixth cap in Cardiff.\nIreland remain on course for a Grand Slam after Prendergast, who kicked 17 points, helped guide them through a tricky spell when Garry Ringrose was given a 20-minute red card in the 34th minute.\nA particular standout moment came when he spiralled a 50-22 over the head of replacement Wales fly-half Jarrod Evans. The execution was \"utter filth\", according to Barclay.\nHaving backed up his player-of-the-match performance against Scotland, Warburton believes Prendergast has edged into top spot.\n\"Without putting too much pressure on him, I see a world-class top-level 10,\" Warburton told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"You just watch him play and you think 'he is Test level'. There are still imperfections, but what he is displaying at 22, with how calm and composed he is, is that level.\"\nFive talking points from round three of Six Nations\nSix Nations: The weekend review with Barclay and Warburton\nSix Nations fixtures, standings, try-scorers & coverage\nThis video can not be played\n'Not this time' - Russell misses late conversion\nVersatility is vital on Lions tours as players often need to play a midweek game a few days after a weekend match.\nThat could help Marcus Smith, who for the second match in a row helped England to narrow wins from full-back.\nThe Harlequin started all England's November Tests at fly-half and despite three defeats was a constant bright spark.\nHowever, a missed tackle on Duhan van der Merwe resulted in Scotland's second try to put questions over his physicality in defence.\nFin Smith's form may have hit his chances of a starting spot at fly-half, but Marcus Smith's ability to cover two positions could give him the edge over an out-and-out 10 if he can hit top form against Italy and Wales.\nScotland full-back Blair Kinghorn, who featured at 10 regularly for his former club Edinburgh, scored a hat-trick against Italy from fly-half in the 2023 Six Nations, but now plays across the back three for Toulouse.\nThe 28-year-old's passing lacked precision in the first half against England, with a forced one-handed pass hitting wing Kyle Rowe in the face.\n\"Kinghorn has played himself out of my team,\" Warburton said. \"He still goes on tour because he is versatile. I will go for Hugo Keenan as someone who is just really safe at the back.\"\nEngland wing Tommy Freeman has scored a try in all three rounds this campaign, and showed his power to crash over against Scotland from close range.\nFormer England wing Ugo Monye believes he is a \"dark horse\" to go on tour, with his ability to play centre also enhancing his chances.\n\"I am not sure why he is not in many Lions conversations. His error count is so low and aerially he is so brilliant,\" Monye told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"He scored England's only try against Scotland, and changed the game against France with his aerial game to get above Louis Bielle-Biarrey [for his try].\"\nThis video can not be played\nSix Nations Rugby Special: How 'superb' Ireland turned it around\nEngland captain Maro Itoje led from the front by producing crucial turnovers to help his side win back the Calcutta Cup for the first time since 2020.\nThe 30-year-old second row took over as skipper from Jamie George before the Six Nations and is a two-time Lion with six appearances in Tests.\nFormer England scrum-half Matt Dawson told Rugby Union Weekly that Itoje, who in 2021 was voted by his team-mates as player of the series in South Africa, has \"some super-human tendencies\" which could make him a Lions captain.\n\"All of a sudden it feels like he has become the player we all thought he was going to be when he has got the armband on,\" Dawson added.\nNumber eight Caelan Doris missed his side's win over Wales because of injury, but given Farrell made him Ireland captain in 2024 is in a strong position.\nWarburton says any of Doris, Itoje or Wales captain Jac Morgan would make a strong Lions captain, but is leaning towards Itoje.\n\"Doris is definitely captaincy-worthy but the number one criteria for your captain has got to be that he is a banker to start, and I think there are some really good number eights,\" Warburton added.\n\"On form, who is inked in and who has worked with Farrell on Lions tours before?

And his kicking game was good too. \"Five talking points from round three of Six NationsPublished1 day agoSix Nations: The weekend review with Barclay and WarburtonSix Nations fixtures, standings, try-scorers & coveragePublished1 day agoThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'Not this time' - Russell misses late conversionUtility backsVersatility is vital on Lions tours as players often need to play a midweek game a few days after a weekend match.That could help Marcus Smith, who for the second match in a row helped England to narrow wins from full-back.The Harlequin started all England's November Tests at fly-half and despite three defeats was a constant bright spark.However, a missed tackle on Duhan van der Merwe resulted in Scotland's second try to put questions over his physicality in defence.Fin Smith's form may have hit his chances of a starting spot at fly-half, but Marcus Smith's ability to cover two positions could give him the edge over an out-and-out 10 if he can hit top form against Italy and Wales.Scotland full-back Blair Kinghorn, who featured at 10 regularly for his former club Edinburgh, scored a hat-trick against Italy from fly-half in the 2023 Six Nations, but now plays across the back three for Toulouse.The 28-year-old's passing lacked precision in the first half against England, with a forced one-handed pass hitting wing Kyle Rowe in the face. \"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Calcutta Cup: Scotland's missed chances and England's problem solvingWarburton's Lions XVLions XV: Keenan; Freeman, Lawrence,  Aki, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Genge, Sheehan, Fagerson, Itoje, Chessum, Morgan, T Curry, Conan.Barclay's Lions XVLions XV: Kinghorn; Van der Merwe, Lawrence,  Aki, Lowe; Russell, Gibson-Park; Porter, Sheehan, Fagerson, Itoje, Beirne, T Curry, Morgan, Conan.Lions watch: Who impressed in Six Nations round one?Published4 FebruaryLions watch week two: Fly-halves, flankers & props starPublished11 FebruaryWhat information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsBritish & Irish LionsRugby Union",

        "article_text": "From a lavish historical epic set in Sicily to a satire of Hollywood studios starring Seth Rogan, and the acclaimed final instalment of British Tudor drama Wolf Hall.\nIt's right there in the title \u2013 you can't keep a Marvel hero down. Or off the screen. After three seasons originally made for Netflix (running from 2015 to 2018), the new Disney+ series brings back the familiar cast of heroes, villains and everything in between. Charlie Cox is Matt Murdoch, aka Daredevil, the blind attorney with superhuman senses that he had once used to fight crime at night, before giving it up at the end of season three. Vincent D'Onofrio is Wilson Fisk, the former mob boss known as Kingpin, now the mayor. \"Why did you stop being a vigilante?\" Fisk asks Murdoch over a friendly cup of coffee at a diner. No matter. That hiatus won't last much longer, as the punching, kicking and mask-wearing action begins. Jon Bernthal is Frank Castle, or Punisher, a brutal vigilante who, unlike Daredevil, never gave it a second thought.\nDaredevil: Born Again premieres 4 March in the US and 5 March in the UK on Disney+.\nLuchino Visconti's 1963 classic film, The Leopard, is still one of the most opulent, romantic, political-historical epics of all time, with Burt Lancaster as the Prince of Salina, head of a fading aristocratic family, and Alain Delon as his revolutionary nephew, Tancredi. Both are caught between the past and the future in 1860s Sicily during the upheaval that unified Italy into one country. Netflix has adapted Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel, the basis for the film, into this lavish six-part series, cast largely with Italian actors and shot in locations throughout Sicily. Kim Rossi Stuart plays the Prince, the leopard of the title, clinging to his old ways. Saul Nanni is Tancredi, whose love affair with Angelica (Deva Cassel) forms the romantic centre of the story, even while revolutionaries storm the streets and Tancredi has to choose his own path, with his uncle or with a new order.\nThe Leopard premieres 5 March on Netflix internationally\nIn his consistently droll voice, John Mulaney has leap-frogged through genres, from a series of priceless stand-up specials to appearing in \u2013 and writing \u2013 instant-classic Saturday Night Live sketches like Lobster Diner, and last year's John Mulaney Presents: Everybody's in LA, a series of six live talk-show episodes presented over consecutive nights. At once sending up and using the tropes of an old-time talk show, Everybody's in LA was such a critical and popular hit that Mulaney returns with this 12-episode series, each show live once a week. Everybody's Live promises a similar meta/retro mix as the last run, which had some amazing, funny guests \u2013 David Letterman and Bill Hader on the same episode, a surprise appearance by Will Ferrell \u2013 viewer call-ins, and offbeat topics like coyotes in Los Angeles. Richard Kind returns in the role of announcer/sidekick, along with Saymo the delivery robot, in a show that is both goofy and satirical.\u00a0\nEverybody's Live with John Mulaney premieres 12 March on Netflix internationally\nStephen Graham is everything everywhere all at once these days (no bad thing). He plays a Victorian-era boxer in A Thousand Blows, which just premiered, and is both star and co-creator with Jack Thorne (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) of this psychological drama which has an unsettling theme. Graham plays Ed Miller, whose 13-year-old son, Jamie, is accused of murdering a girl who went to his school. Ashley Waters (Top Boy) plays a detective investigating the murder, and Erin Doherty (the crime boss in A Thousand Blows) is the psychologist assigned to treat Jamie. Each of the four episodes is shot in one continuous take, playing out in real time, which might add to the tension. The real test will be how effective that strategy is. Adolescence is directed by Philip Barantini, who made the one-shot approach so effective in the 2021 film Boiling Point (which, need we add, stars Stephen Graham).\nAdolescence premieres 13 March on Netflix internationally\nIn this drama that mixes elements of the police procedural with a family story of addiction, Amanda Seyfried plays Mickey Fitzgerald, a beat cop in Philadelphia assigned to the neighbourhood where she grew up, a place ravaged by the opioid crisis. When several women are serially murdered, she suspects the case might lead her to her sister, Kacey (Ashleigh Cummings), an addict and sex worker who has disappeared. The show weaves between past and present, with flashbacks to the sisters' fraught relationship and divergent paths, as Mickey deals with life as a single mother and with her increasing obsession with finding Kacey. The show has a lot to live up to. It is based on a bestselling novel by Liz Moore, who cowrote the series with its showrunner, Nikki Toscano. NPR called the book one of the Best of 2020, and if that's not enough, Barack Obama put it on his list of favourite books of the year.\nLong Bright River premieres 13 March on Peacock\nRidley Scott directed the first episode of this crime series, which becomes more than the typical drugs-and-criminals thriller thanks to its lead actors. Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta, If Beale Street Could Talk) and Wagner Moura (Civil War) play old friends in Philadelphia with a small-time scam. Posing as agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, they pretend to raid drug houses while really searching for cash to steal. By the end of episode one, they have targeted the wrong meth lab, and are on the run from both real government agents and the dealers whose business they literally blew up in an explosion. Henry and Moura bring unusual sympathy to the characters as the show combines the tension of their life-or-death danger with the stories of the people they care about and try to protect. Henry's character is especially affecting in his love for the stepmother who raised him (Kate Mulgrew). Peter Craig, a co-writer of The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick, created the series, which has a gritty texture that recalls The Wire.\nDope Thief premieres 14 March on Apple TV+ internationally\nEllen Pompeo and Mark Duplass star as Kristine and Michael Barnett in a series\u00a0 inspired by a tabloid-ready real-life case. The Barnetts adopt a seven-year-old Ukrainian orphan named Natalia Grace (Imogen Faith Reid), who has a rare form of dwarfism, and whose first adopted family has returned her. The trailer hints at a good deal of heightened drama, as Kristine begins to suspect that they do not know the truth about their child's age. \"Michael, I don't think she's a little girl,\" she says, a suspicion that eventually takes the couple all the way to court. Dule Hill plays a detective investigating the tangle of accusations and fears, and it is tangled. The actual events, which began in 2010, are so unusual and the saga so ongoing that it has already inspired three seasons of a documentary series on the Investigation Discovery Channel.\nGood American Family premieres 19 March on Hulu in the US and 7 May on Disney+ in the UK\nNetflix is calling this murder mystery from Shonda Rhimes's production company a\u00a0 \"screwball whodunit,\" with Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, a brilliant detective investigating a murder in the White House during a state dinner. With a comic tone and a cast of 157 suspects, it's Upstairs Downstairs at the White House with a corpse, as Cupp questions everyone from the assistant usher (Susan Kelechi Watson) and the pastry chef (Bronson Pinchot) to the president's mother-in-law (Jane Curtain) and oldest friend (Ken Marino). Randall Park plays an FBI agent who investigates with Cordelia, and as the trailer reveals, Giancarlo Esposito plays the murder victim, who had the important job of chief usher and was not popular with his staff. The show was created by Paul William Davies, a writer on Rhimes's White House-set series Scandal, who has gone for a very different tone here. His goal for the show was to \"Keep it FUN,\" he told Netflix. \"I want people to be entertained, I want them to laugh.\" The Residence arrives in a very different political landscape to the one in which it was created, and it will be interesting to see whether finding laughter in the White House now lands as escapist entertainment or tone-deafness.\u00a0\nThe Residence premieres 20 March on Netflix internationally\nViewers in the US have had to wait four months to see the series the Guardian called \"utter TV magic\" when it premiered on the BBC last November, but here it is. The second instalment of Wolf Hall, it is based on the last of Hilary Mantel's trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, the savvy but doomed advisor to Henry VIII.\u00a0Just as Mantel set the standard for historical novels, the first Wolf Hall series, adapted from the first two books, did the same for smart, beautifully made historical TV dramas. Nine years later, the ensemble that put that first part together is back, on screen and off, with Mark Rylance as Cromwell, Damian Lewis as Henry and Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Wolsey. The series was adapted by Peter Straughn, who was nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave (he's good at writing men in robes) and directed by Peter Kosminsky. The story picks up in 1536, the blood still fresh from Anne Boleyn's head rolling, and although history tells us how badly it all ends, watching the court intrigue unfold here in such ravishing detail is exhilarating.\nWolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres 23 March on PBS in the US\nHollywood studios are an irresistible target of satire, from Robert Altman's 1992 gem The Player to Armando Iannucci's recent series The Franchise. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the co-creators of this series, have now made them the subject of a very funny romp, overflowing with cameos from real-life actors and directors. Rogan plays Matt Remick, a production executive who longs to greenlight art films. That's an unlikely goal after he is promoted to head of Continental Studios, with the mandate to make commercial hits. One project his corporate bosses insist on: a film based on Kool-Aid. If a product-inspired movie worked for Barbie, why not a soft drink? The first episode includes cameos from Martin Scorsese and Steve Buscemi. Paul Dano, Olivia Wilde, Charlize Theron, Anthony Mackie and many others play outsized versions of themselves. And the casting of the regular characters is inspired. Ike Barniholtz plays Matt's second-in-command and best friend, Catherine O'Hara is the mentor whose job Matt took, and Kathryn Hahn the studio's brash head of publicity.\nThe Studio premieres 26 March on Apple TV+ internationally\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He proposed doing so by leveraging its resources, including critical minerals and metals, as well as making Canada a \"superpower of clean energy\" and removing trade barriers between provinces.\nHe, too, agreed with Freeland that Trump's second term was different from the first.\n\"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets.

As the four debated, Trudeau was in Kyiv marking three years since the Russia-Ukraine war began.\nAll four candidates agreed that Canada should continue supporting Ukraine. Freeland suggested that money seized from Russia through sanctions be redistributed to help Ukraine's war effort, while Carney stated that any discussion on Ukraine's future could not happen without the Ukrainians at the table.\nFreeland also suggested that Canada should foster closer ties with Denmark which, she noted. was also facing threats from Trump who has signalled his desire to take over Greenland - a Danish territory.\nFor the second half of the debate, candidates offered up their ideas for how to help Canada reduce its federal budget deficit, tackle crime and increase its military spending.\nThey were also asked about climate change, with both Freeland and Carney saying they no longer supported a carbon tax on consumers - a key climate policy of the Trudeau government that has become unpopular with Canadians.\nAt certain points, candidates also took aim at Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, saying he would be unfit to defend Canada against Trump.\nPoilievre is currently leading in the national polls, though the gap between him and the Liberal Party has narrowed since Trudeau's resignation.

        "article_text": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of J\u00f8rn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023.\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it \u2013 the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\u00a0\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018.\nThe judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\u00a0\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A\u00a33.5m or A$7m \u2013 at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 \u2013 the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\u00a0\nBut this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A\u00a312.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\nThe project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors \u2013 the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\u00a0\nUtzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\u00a0\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (\u00a351m).\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The first ever video game console\n\u2022\u00a0How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe\n\u2022\u00a0How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (\u00a333m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him.\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAs a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Bj\u00f6rk\u00a0and Massive Attack. In 1980,\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger\u00a0won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Leaders Liverpool, who won at Manchester City on Sunday, have the best away record in the Premier League this season\nFormer Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson once said \"we always depend on our home form\" - but how much can teams really depend on it?\nSo far this season, only 38.7% of Premier League games have been won by the side playing at home - the second-lowest on record.\nAfter a weekend which saw seven out of 10 fixtures won by the away team, what has happened to so-called home advantage?\nBBC Sport looks at the numbers behind this season and tries to explain why it may be happening.\nOnly once during the Premier League era has there been a lower proportion of home wins during a season than in 2024-25 - and that was the Covid-affected 2020-21 campaign.\nIn a season largely played without supporters present at games because the country was in lockdown, only 37.9% of matches were won by the home team, with away wins up at 40.3%.\nBut while the proportion of home wins is again low this season, there is no trend in the numbers to suggest this had been coming.\nWith supporters returning in 2021-22, home victories were back up at 42.9% and even rose to 48.4% during the following campaign - the seventh-highest in the league's history.\nThe overall percentage of home wins since the Premier League's inception in 1992-93 is 45.7%, with 5,795 out of 12,667 games won by the home side.\nThis would suggest that not only is home advantage very much a thing - but that without fans present that edge was lost. \nSo what's happened in 2024-25?\nMuch has been made this season about the increase in teams attacking quickly in transition, rather than the territory and possession-based football made so fashionable by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.\nAs Guardiola recently said himself: \"Modern football is not positional. You have to ride the rhythm.\"\nTeams like Bournemouth have had huge success playing in this more aggressive style - but does it also help sides playing away from home, with less onus on them to dominate the ball and push forward, but instead break quickly and hit teams on the counter-attack?\nThe percentage of goals scored after \"fast breaks\", according to Opta, has never been higher than this season.\nOne in 10 goals are scored like this - 10.2% - with the next highest proportion down at 7.7% in 2022-23.\nThe average number of fast breaks per game is up in general, as is the number of direct attacks per game.\nIt feeds into the notion of the classic, archetypal 'away goal' - soak up pressure, win the ball back and hit the home side on the break.\nOn the subject of away goals - there have been a lot of them. The 1.52 goals per game on average scored by away teams this season is the highest-ever in the Premier League.\nWhy Guardiola's tactics stopped working amid rise of rapid football\nEmbracing the chaos - breaking down Bournemouth's rise\nGoing back to Ferguson's quote, his Manchester United side were famed for making their Old Trafford home a fortress when they dominated English football for long periods during the 1990s and 2000s.\nAfter their 3-0 win there in December, Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola even modestly said: \"It doesn't happen a lot that you come to this kind of stadium and win 3-0.\"\nBut this isn't quite the case anymore, with the Red Devils losing seven of their 13 home games so far in 2024-25.\nOld Trafford isn't the only big ground which seems to have lost its fear-factor.\nChelsea, who went 86 games unbeaten at Stamford Bridge between 2004-2008, have only won six of their 12 matches at home this season - despite an improved showing on last campaign.\nMeanwhile, champions Manchester City have already lost three times at Etihad Stadium after a 52-game unbeaten run at home in all competitions was ended by Tottenham's 4-0 win there in November.\nAcross the entire league, no side remains unbeaten on their own ground, with runaway leaders Liverpool holding the best home record with nine wins, two draws and one defeat.\nAnd the old adage that you have to win your home games to stay up? Well, the bottom three have just four home wins in 41 matches between them.\nThe Covid-19 era showed fans likely had a positive impact on how home teams performed - but can home supporters have a negative effect too?\nSome might say the Goodison Park grumbles which accompanied Sean Dyche's final days as Everton boss are in stark contrast to the partisan passion on show under David Moyes' resurgent side. Have fans had an influence there?\nSome of this season's struggling teams have seen their own supporters turn hostile on occasion.\n\"You're not fit to wear the shirt,\" was one chant aimed at Leicester City players by Foxes fans in Friday's 4-0 home defeat by Brentford at King Power stadium.\nIt's a ground where protests against the club's hierarchy have been commonplace in recent weeks - a period in which, perhaps coincidentally, Leicester's home form has seen six consecutive league defeats without scoring - setting a new unwanted Premier League record in the process.\nLeicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy agrees supporters have a right to voice their opinion - but speaking before the Brentford game, he emphasised just how much fan backing can mean to teams.\n\"Looking back as a player, when you played in front of your home crowd and there is a connection from a tackle, pass, cross or difficult moments in a game where support is lifting you, I know as a coach and someone who loves sports and football what it does to the team,\" he explained.\nSimilar, though perhaps less vocal protests, have been witnessed at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in recent months.\nIronically, the most visible signs of discontent came as Spurs beat Manchester United earlier this month - but home fans had not seen their injury-hit team win at home in the league since early November, and that three-month wait for a home league win included defeats by relegation-battlers Ipswich Town and Leicester.\nWhile there has been some chat this season about employing the \"dark arts\" - just cast your mind back to the chaos surrounding Man City v Arsenal last September - there's an argument this continues to be on the decline in football.\nTime-wasting directives from the Premier League since the start of last season have perhaps discouraged away teams from negatively slowing the game down in an attempt to pinch a draw.\nAverage ball-in-play time this campaign - 57.05 minutes - is the second-highest for any season since Opta started recording the number in 2006-07.\nWhen you add in the watchful eye of the video assistant referee, players having to temporarily leave the field if they receive treatment, and players who are substituted being able to exit the pitch anywhere, it's only becoming harder for away teams to adopt stifling tactics.\nMaybe sides not winning as many home games is simply down to teams being better set up to win away from home - and having more reasons to try to do so.\nThat and the fact there isn't a single grey away kit, external in the Premier League this season...\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "summary": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Leaders Liverpool, who won at Manchester City on Sunday, have the best away record in the Premier League this seasonPublished24 February 2025667 CommentsFormer Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson once said \"we always depend on our home form\" - but how much can teams really depend on it?So far this season, only 38.7% of Premier League games have been won by the side playing at home - the second-lowest on record.After a weekend which saw seven out of 10 fixtures won by the away team, what has happened to so-called home advantage?BBC Sport looks at the numbers behind this season and tries to explain why it may be happening.What do the stats show?Only once during the Premier League era has there been a lower proportion of home wins during a season than in 2024-25 - and that was the Covid-affected 2020-21 campaign.In a season largely played without supporters present at games because the country was in lockdown, only 37.9% of matches were won by the home team, with away wins up at 40.3%.But while the proportion of home wins is again low this season, there is no trend in the numbers to suggest this had been coming.With supporters returning in 2021-22, home victories were back up at 42.9% and even rose to 48.4% during the following campaign - the seventh-highest in the league's history.The overall percentage of home wins since the Premier League's inception in 1992-93 is 45.7%, with 5,795 out of 12,667 games won by the home side.This would suggest that not only is home advantage very much a thing - but that without fans present that edge was lost. \"Looking back as a player, when you played in front of your home crowd and there is a connection from a tackle, pass, cross or difficult moments in a game where support is lifting you, I know as a coach and someone who loves sports and football what it does to the team,\" he explained.Similar, though perhaps less vocal protests, have been witnessed at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in recent months.Ironically, the most visible signs of discontent came as Spurs beat Manchester United earlier this month - but home fans had not seen their injury-hit team win at home in the league since early November, and that three-month wait for a home league win included defeats by relegation-battlers Ipswich Town and Leicester.Any other reasons?While there has been some chat this season about employing the \"dark arts\" - just cast your mind back to the chaos surrounding Man City v Arsenal last September - there's an argument this continues to be on the decline in football.Time-wasting directives from the Premier League since the start of last season have perhaps discouraged away teams from negatively slowing the game down in an attempt to pinch a draw.Average ball-in-play time this campaign - 57.05 minutes - is the second-highest for any season since Opta started recording the number in 2006-07.When you add in the watchful eye of the video assistant referee, players having to temporarily leave the field if they receive treatment, and players who are substituted being able to exit the pitch anywhere, it's only becoming harder for away teams to adopt stifling tactics.Maybe sides not winning as many home games is simply down to teams being better set up to win away from home - and having more reasons to try to do so.That and the fact there isn't a single grey away kit, external in the Premier League this season...Related topicsFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 January The 1.52 goals per game on average scored by away teams this season is the highest-ever in the Premier League.Why Guardiola's tactics stopped working amid rise of rapid footballPublished2 days agoEmbracing the chaos - breaking down Bournemouth's risePublished24 JanuaryAre traditional home fortresses crumbling?Going back to Ferguson's quote, his Manchester United side were famed for making their Old Trafford home a fortress when they dominated English football for long periods during the 1990s and 2000s.After their 3-0 win there in December, Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola even modestly said: \"It doesn't happen a lot that you come to this kind of stadium and win 3-0.

        "article_text": "Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho heads down the tunnel after being substituted in the 3-2 win against Ipswich\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim said he would speak to Alejandro Garnacho after the winger went straight to the dressing room when he was substituted in the first half of the 3-2 win against Ipswich.\nAmorim replaced Argentina international Garnacho with defender Noussair Mazraoui two minutes before half-time following Patrick Dorgu's red card.\nIt was raining heavily at Old Trafford and Garnacho seemed to indicate he wanted to take his shirt off, so he headed down the touchline to the dressing room rather than take a place on the bench.\nIt is not known whether he stayed for the second half.\n\"I am going to talk with Garnacho about that,\" said Amorim.\nIn December, the 20-year-old attacker was dropped for the derby against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium along with Marcus Rashford, partly due to his poor performance in training and his attitude.\nUnlike Rashford, who has not played for United since and is now on loan at Aston Villa, Garnacho returned to first-team duties immediately.\n\"You are making a connection with Rashford,\" said Amorim, assessing Wednesday's situation.\n\"It was cold and wet.\"\nAmorim's decision was a tactical one stemming from the red card, allowing his team to largely keep their original shape with five at the back.\n\"The thinking was that we would play 5-3-1. That is a risk because he [Garnacho] is the one who can play one-v-one in pace,\" Amorim said. \"We had to choose someone to go out. It was my choice.\"\nThe Debrief: Man Utd edge Ipswich, Arsenal stutter & Liverpool go 13 clear\nMan Utd planning post-season matches in Asia\nModern players find criticism offensive - Ten Hag\nThis video can not be played\nNot perfect or pretty but Man Utd stayed in control - Amorin\nThis has been a tough week at United, with news that more staff members will be losing their jobs.\nUnited's victory therefore will come as little comfort to those directly affected, no matter how entertaining this game proved to be.\nA mid-season home win against opposition who look destined for a swift return to the Championship is not going to live long in the memory. \nHowever, the manner of the success, fighting back from the concession of a shambolic early opening goal and rallying again after a red card and another avoidable goal, was greeted with enthusiasm from the stands at the final whistle.\n\"The fans' support was amazing,\" said Amorim. \"I have felt that since day one.\n\"They want to see the team fight to the end, no matter what the situation. We did that today. All the things in the game were against us, but we fought through that. You feel the connection. It was a good win for us.\"\nPrivately, United officials accept this has been a traumatic week and that chief executive Omar Berrada did not find it easy on Monday to stand before staff and tell them the bad news that up to 200 jobs could go in the next four months.\nIt is perfectly believable when some currently working at the club say morale among the rank and file is at its lowest ebb.\nBut the conviction among those running United is absolute that the changes needed to be made.\nTheir problem is an understanding that off-field decisions are assessed through the prism of results at first-team level. And the results have been terrible.\nEarly in this contest, with Ipswich leading through the atrocious mix-up that offered Jaden Philogene a fourth-minute tap-in, the visiting fans offered their own pretty blunt assessment of United. The words were somewhat more industrial but effectively: \"You're really not very good.\"\nThat's fair enough when assessing opponents who are supposed to be challenging for major honours but started this game 15th in the table.\nYet those responsible for making key decisions are adamant faith in Amorim remains high. They feel what is currently being endured amounts to teething problems with a coach trying to implement a new system.\nAnother change, it is argued, will merely repeat past mistakes. The club have been in a malaise for years, it could be said, and the cycle has to be broken.\nHowever, there is also an acceptance this will not be straightforward.\nAmorim noted that this success - like the robust rearguard action that brought an FA Cup victory with 10 men at Arsenal and a defiant draw against champions-elect Liverpool - was not achieved in the manner he wants his side to play.\n\"We need to survive, but it is hard for me to play like we play in the second half because I feel the players are more comfortable defending the low block,\" Amorim said.\nAmazingly, United have now matched their best form under Amorim by going two Premier League games without defeat.\nThey are up to 14th but are nine points off the top half of the table and a distant 13 away from a Champions League place, even if the Premier League gets five places as expected.\nNo-one at Old Trafford expects Amorim's side to go on a huge winning run to the end of the season.\nHowever, there is a feeling that they can improve \u2013 and results in the FA Cup fifth-round tie with Fulham on Sunday and the Europa League last-16 tie with Real Sociedad are crucial to maintaining hopes of European qualification. Dorgu will miss the Fulham game through suspension.\nAmorim has learned already that the price of being associated with United is that any action of significance will be amplified. The glare of publicity is fierce.\nPlenty at the club noted within the reaction to this week's cost-cutting news at United that not many employers offer staff the free lunches that are being taken away. Other companies have made far more people redundant.\nBut the allure of United drives interest and therefore commercial revenues far beyond most comparable-sized businesses.\nThere is always attention on United, whether about matters on or off the pitch.\nDebate surrounding this game will not be about the result but about that ridiculous opening goal when Dorgu and Andre Onana practically waved Ipswich through to score.\n\"When everybody watched that ball, they thought 'here we go again',\" said Amorim.\nAnd there was much to discuss about Dorgu's red card.\nAmorim stressed he saw no malice, explaining: \"He doesn't want to harm anyone. Sometimes you overdo it.\"\nSo, Amorim's fourth home Premier League win as United head coach had plenty of drama about it.\nBut it will take far more than this to sweep away the dark clouds currently hanging over Old Trafford.\nSix points separate eight teams - how race for Europe is shaping up\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

Just continue and you are going to score many goals.\"\nChelsea back in top four with Southampton win\nPalmer started the season in red-hot form for the Blues, scoring 14 goals and creating six assists across his first 21 Premier League appearances. However, he has zero goal involvements since.\nMany Chelsea supporters, as well as Fantasy Football fans, had pencilled in Chelsea's home match against a Southampton side who sit bottom of the league and have the worst defensive record as the fixture where Palmer would restart his goalscoring form.\nAnd the former Manchester City man did find himself on the end of several chances, having seven shots - the joint-highest total for a Chelsea player in the league this season.\nPalmer missed two glorious opportunities when one-on-one in the first half with one effort saved by Aaron Ramsdale and another dragged wide. After the restart he blasted a cut-back over the bar.\nIn total, his chances accumulated to an expected goals (xG) figure of 1.07.\nAfter he had a late free-kick saved by Ramsdale, Palmer reacted by smiling, appearing to see the funny side of his barren run, which Maresca praised in his post-match press conference.\n\"It is how you react. He is reacting perfectly. He is smiling and he is happy. We have no doubt he will score more goals,\" Maresca said.\n\"He's a human being. All human beings, all big players, all the normal players, big club, big manager - we all go through  a bad moment.\n\"Even if he is young, he shared time in a big club and he knows that all the big players go through moments like this.\"\nPalmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in September, 2023 and has since scored 39 goals across all competitions.\nPedro Neto has scored three Premier League goals this season\nStepping up on Tuesday were forwards Christopher Nkunku and Pedro Neto who both scored one and assisted another.\nWith striker Nicolas Jackson absent with a thigh injury, Neto, who was signed as a winger, once again played centrally in a false-nine role.\n\"We needed to find a solution,\" added Maresca. \"We tried one game with Palmer and we tried one game with Nkunku, Brighton away \u2013 didn't work well.\n\"So the week after, we tried with Pedro in the week and we saw that it could work. I think Villa away he did fantastic. He probably give us a threat in-behind.\nNeto scored Chelsea's second, running on to a Nkunku through-ball before calmly finishing past Ramsdale.\n\"He is not just receiving the ball at the feet,\" added Maresca. \"He also likes to attack in-behind something which Cole and Christopher struggle [to do].\"\nNeto has scored just three goals and created four assists in the Premier League this season, although two of those goals and two of those assists have come in the past four games.\nBefore the match with Southampton about 100 Chelsea fans protested against the club's ownership with banners and chants.\nIt has been nearly three years since the BlueCo consortium fronted by Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali acquired the club.\n\"The only thing I can say is that in this moment the fans have to trust,\" said Maresca.\n\"We're in the right process and the right direction.

Fellow top-tier side Le Havre suffered the same fate in December.\nCentre-back Hugo Boudin was Stade Briochin's unlikely hero against Nice, scoring an 88th-minute equaliser before snatching a winner in the seventh minute of stoppage time.\nThe final whistle prompted a pitch invasion at the 11,000-capacity Stade Fred-Aubert in Brittany. For Stade Briochin coach Guillaume Allanou, whose association with the club stretches back three decades, it is a memory that will never fade.\n\"My first thought at this moment when all the fans were on the pitch was to search for my players,\" Allanou tells BBC Sport. \"I wanted to be with my staff and my players just together to celebrate this great moment.\n\"It was unbelievable. It was like we were not in our bodies. It was crazy, emotional. It's difficult to explain in words.\"\nThe Nice result saw Stade Briochin enter the pantheon of great Coupe de France upsets.\nThey are in good company, joining US Quevily, third-tier conquerors of Marseille in the 2012 quarter-finals, and Les Herbiers, another third division club who beat RC Lens on their way to the 2018 final. It was PSG who ended their fairytale run at the last hurdle.\nFourth-tier Calais famously made it to the final in 2000, beating reigning Ligue 1 champions Bordeaux in the semis, before losing to Nantes while US Jeanne d'Arc Carquefou, from the fifth level of French football, beat top-tier sides Nancy and Marseille to make the quarter-finals in 2008. \nPSG, again, were the side to put an end to their run.\nThis year, fourth-tier AS Cannes, formerly of the top flight and the club who gave Zinedine Zidane his breakthrough, have already reached the semi-finals after continuing their own remarkable run by beating Ligue 2 Guingamp on Tuesday. \nParis Saint-Germain are 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1\nIf Stade Briochin can succeed where Les Herbiers failed and down the mighty Parisiens, Allanou feels it would eclipse all other giant-killings.\n\"These clubs have made a great story in the Coupe de France but if we can beat Paris St-Germain, it will be the biggest upset in the history of French football,\" Allanou states.\n\"Nobody can beat PSG in France, or even in Europe. So imagine if Stade Briochin did this? I can't dream of that - if it happens, it will be amazing.\"\nAllanou's history in football has been closely intertwined with that of Stade Briochin. As a teenage defender in the mid-1990s he played during the club's short-lived spell in Ligue 2 - the highest level they have reached.\nThe experience was bittersweet because it ended with Stade Briochin being relegated after facing liquidation.\n\"It's like a story of love with this club,\" he explains. \"The club is a big part of my life. All that I have lived in this club, all the experiences - good and bad - made me the man that I am today.\n\"I was young when I played in Ligue 2 and it was a great experience but a short experience. I remember I arrived to training one day and people said to me 'no there is no club any more, you can't train'. I just wanted to play football.\"\nThankfully, Stade Briochin were resurrected and Allanou had three separate spells at the club as a player, eventually ending his career there at the end of the 2013-14 season.\nThe association continued post-retirement and Allanou is now Stade Briochin's coach and their president. When the club again fell on hard times and faced folding altogether, he stepped in with some other former players to rescue it.\n\"The club was in a bad place,\" he recalls. \"It had a chief executive but he left and then no-one wanted to take it. There was no money, no ambition - so because there was a group of players who love this club and we didn't want the club to die, I became president. I didn't want to be a president but it happened and it's OK.\"\nIn the Brittany town of Saint-Brieuc, cup fever has certainly descended. On Saturday, Allanou and his players met fans in the town centre, where the shops have been decked out in the team's yellow and blue colours.\nIn a blow to the French football romantics, however, the match against PSG will take place at Roazhon Park, the home of Ligue 1 side Rennes. The financial benefits of filling the 30,000-seater stadium make it an understandable choice, though it is located nearly an hour away from Saint-Brieuc.\n\"We wanted to do a big match with a lot of people because we want this to be a big party for us,\" Allanou explains. \"It's a great atmosphere in the town.\n\"For all of my players it will be the match of their life. The difficulty for me as a coach is to make sure they are not scared to play in front of all these people against these big players.\n\"I just want them to live in the moment and play like I know that they can play.\"\nLed by fearsome France forwards Ousmane Dembele and Bradley Barcola, PSG have scored 94 goals in all competitions this season\nThey head into the Stade Briochin game on the back of a 10-0 aggregate demolition of Brest in the Champions League, while Sunday's 3-2 victory over Lyon took Luis Enrique's side 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1.\n\"It is a big mountain for us,\" Allanou says. \"PSG is maybe the best team in the world right now. Luis Enrique has done a very good job with this team. I have so much admiration for him because PSG has a real identity of play.\n\"I love the football that he wants to play and also he has said that the team is more important than any [individual] player. I admire his work and I will say this to him, of course.\"\nStade Briochin captain James Le Marer is retiring at the end of the current campaign\nAllanou has several experienced players to call on. Goalkeeper Franck L'Hostis is a former France U20 international who came through at Monaco, while defensive midfielder Guillaume Beghin began his career at Lens and centre-back Benjamin Angouna played for Guingamp and has 15 senior caps for the Ivory Coast.\nThen there is captain James le Marer. Retiring at the end of this season, 33-year-old Le Marer is a one-club man who has shown levels of loyalty that Paolo Maldini and Ryan Giggs would be proud of.\nWhatever happens against PSG it has still been a fairytale swansong for the Stade Briochin skipper, who is already coaching the club's Under-16 team. Le Marer looks to be on his way to emulating Allanou's lifelong association with the Brittany outfit.\n\"James has a particular story with the club like me,\" Allanou says. \"He's been here since 13 years old and he will stop his career at the end of this season.\n\"It's the biggest match of his life and I'm happy that he can live this with me and with all the other players.\n\"The feeling is to appreciate this moment because I know that after the match the spotlight will probably be turned off.\"",

        "article_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the complete demilitarisation of much of southern Syria.\nIt is an announcement that could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria, after the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad, more likely.\nIn a speech to Israeli military cadets on Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel would not allow the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Assad - nor the new Syrian army that is being formed to \"enter the area south of Damascus\".\n\"We demand the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Deraa and Suweida from the forces of the new regime,\" he added. \"Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.\"\nHe also said that Israeli forces would remain indefinitely inside the Syrian territory that they have seized since Assad's fall last December - which would be a shift in Israeli strategy.\nUntil now, Israel had described its move into a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan Heights as a temporary measure to ensure the security of Israelis on the other side.\nThe rationale appeared to be to prevent extremist groups from moving down to the Golan in the power vacuum.\nBut with his latest comments, Netanyahu has made it clear that he believes that the new authorities in Syria - with their background in jihadism - could represent a similar danger.\nIsrael seized most of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed.

        "summary": "Israel demands complete demilitarisation of southern Syria19 hours agoSebastian UsherBBC Middle East analystReporting fromJerusalemGetty ImagesIsraeli forces inside southern Syria's Quneitra province earlier in FebruaryIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the complete demilitarisation of much of southern Syria.It is an announcement that could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria, after the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad, more likely.In a speech to Israeli military cadets on Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel would not allow the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Assad - nor the new Syrian army that is being formed to \"enter the area south of Damascus\".\"We demand the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Deraa and Suweida from the forces of the new regime,\" he added. \"Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.\"He also said that Israeli forces would remain indefinitely inside the Syrian territory that they have seized since Assad's fall last December - which would be a shift in Israeli strategy.Until now, Israel had described its move into a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan Heights as a temporary measure to ensure the security of Israelis on the other side.The rationale appeared to be to prevent extremist groups from moving down to the Golan in the power vacuum.But with his latest comments, Netanyahu has made it clear that he believes that the new authorities in Syria - with their background in jihadism - could represent a similar danger.Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so in 2019.Getty ImagesSyrian protested against Netanyahu's demand on Monday in Quneitra provinceSyria's new interim President, HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, has tried to reassure Israel that he does not want conflict and that he is ready to uphold the long-standing disengagement agreement between the two countries concluded after another war in 1973.He has also stressed that he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks against Israel.But Sharaa has also called on Israel to withdraw from the buffer zone it has taken, as he tries to assert sovereignty across the whole of Syria's fractured landscape.Clearly, Netanyahu does not trust these assurances.Like much of the international community, the Israeli prime minister is waiting to see if Sharaa makes good on his moderate, emollient stance in action as well as words.From the perspective of the new Syrian leadership, freeing the country from the influence of all the foreign powers that jockeyed for position during the long years of civil war is seen as vital to ensuring a more positive future for the country and a definitive break with the past.Some foreign players, such as Iran and Russia, have seen for now at least the curtailment of the overweening influence they once had.Under President Donald Trump, the US might also further disengage from Syria - a role which has helped underpin Kurdish-led forces in the north-east of the country.There has, though, been growing influence from Turkey - which provided essential support for HTS in its lightning campaign against Assad.How big a part it chooses to play could be a determining factor in how Syria develops in the post-Assad era.But Israel may present a more immediate challenge to the independence of Syria's new leadership.To have Israeli troops increasingly infringing on the country's territory - as well as carrying out numerous strikes on targets associated with what's left of Assad's military arsenal - does not fit with the vision of a re-unified, sovereign state that Sharaa is trying to convince Syrians both inside and outside the country that his leadership can provide.Netanyahu's move to forbid Syrian forces from operating freely within the country's borders may be a step too far for the new order in Damascus to stomach, however non-confrontational an image it is trying to maintain.Satellite imagery reveals Israeli military construction in buffer zone with Syria'We just need peace': BBC speaks to Syrians watching Israel's incursionIsraeli army prepares to stay on border peak of Mt Hermon for winterIsrael seizing on Syria chaos to strike military assetsIsrael seizes Golan buffer zone after Syrian troops leave positionsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuSyria",

        "article_text": "Stargazers will be treated to a rare alignment of seven planets on 28 February when Mercury joins six other planets that are already visible in the night sky. Here's why it matters to scientists.\nPeer up at the sky on a clear night at the end of February and you could be in for a treat. Through out January and February six planets \u2013 Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2013 have been visible in the night sky. During just one night \u2013 28 February \u2013 they will be joined by Mercury, a rare seven-planet alignment visible in the sky. It is a spectacle that will not be visible again until 2040.\nBut such events are not just a treat for stargazers \u2013 they can also have a real impact on our Solar System and offer the opportunity to gain new insights about our place within it.\nThe eight major planets of our Solar System orbit the Sun in the same flat plane, and all at different speeds. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, completes an orbit \u2013 a year for the planet \u2013 in 88 days. Earth's year, of course, is 365 days, while at the upper end, Neptune takes a whopping 60,190 days, or about 165 Earth years, to complete a single revolution of our star.\nThe different speeds of the planets mean that, on occasion, several of them can be roughly lined up on the same side of the Sun. From Earth, if the orbits line up just right, we can see multiple planets in our night sky at the same time. In rare events, all the planets will line up such that they all appear in our night sky together along the ecliptic, the path traced by the Sun.\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are all bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, while Uranus and Neptune require binoculars or a telescope to spot.\nIn January and February 2025, it has been possible to witness this event taking place. The planets are not exactly lined up, so they appear in an arc across the sky due to their orbital plane in the Solar System. During clear nights, all of the planets except Mercury should be visible \u2013 an event sometimes called a planetary parade. On 28 February, though \u2013 weather permitting \u2013 all seven planets will be visible, a great spectacle for observers on the ground.\n\"There is something special about looking at the planets with your own eyes,\" says Jenifer Millard, a science communicator and astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in the UK. \"Yes, you can go on Google and get a more spectacular view of all these planets. But when you're looking at these objects, these are photons that have travelled millions or billions of miles through space to hit your retinas.\"\nWhile fascinating to observe, do such alignments have any impact here on Earth? Or might they have a use for increasing our understanding of our Solar System and beyond?\nIn fact, says Millard, \"it's just happenstance that they happen to be in this position of their orbits\". And while there have been suggestions from some scientists that planetary alignments might cause impacts on Earth, the scientific basis for most of these claims is weak or non-existent.\nIn 2019, however, researchers suggested that planetary alignments could have an impact on solar activity. One of the main outstanding questions about the Sun is what drives its 11-year cycle between periods of peak activity, known as solar maximum (which we are currently in), and periods of weakest activity, solar minimum. Frank Stefani, a physicist at Helmholtz-Zentrum research centre in Dresden-Rossendorf in Germany, believes the combined tidal forces of Venus, Earth and Jupiter could be the answer.\nWhile the tidal pull of each planet on the Sun is extremely small, Stefani says that when two or more of the planets line up with the Sun \u2013 known as a syzygy \u2013 they might combine to cause small rotations inside the star, called Rossby waves, which can drive weather events.\n\"On Earth, Rossby waves cause cyclones and anticyclones,\" says Stefani. \"We have the same Rossby waves in the Sun.\" Stefani's calculations showed that the alignments of Venus, Earth and Jupiter would cause a periodicity to solar activity of 11.07 years, almost exactly matching the length of solar cycles that we see.\nNot everyone is so sure about the idea, with some noting that solar activity can already be explained by processes within the Sun alone. \"The observational evidence suggests that the planets directly causing the solar cycle just doesn't happen,\" says Robert Cameron, a solar scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System research in Germany, who published a paper on the subject in 2022. \"There's no evidence of any synchronisation.\"\nBut there are other, far less contentious, quirks of planetary alignments which certainly do have an impact on us: their usefulness for scientific observations, particularly in terms of exploring the Solar System.\nReaching the outer planets with a spacecraft is difficult because these worlds are so far away, billions of miles, and would take decades to reach. However, using the gravitational pull of a well-placed planet, such as Jupiter, to slingshot a spacecraft outwards can reduce the travel time dramatically, something no spacecraft has done better than Nasa's Voyager vehicles.\nIn 1966, a Nasa scientist called Gary Flandro calculated that there would be an alignment of the four outermost planets \u2013 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2013 in 1977 that would enable all four to be visited within a span of just 12 years, compared to 30 years if they were not aligned. This fortuitous alignment, which occurs only once every 175 years, led to Nasa launching the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1977 on a \"Grand Tour\" of the outer Solar System.\nVoyager 1 flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, eschewing Uranus and Neptune because scientists wanted to fly past Titan, Saturn's fascinating moon, and could not do so without ruining the slingshot effect.\nBut Voyager 2 used the alignment to visit all four planets, becoming the only spacecraft in history to visit Uranus and Neptune, in 1986 and 1989 respectively.\n\"That worked out fantastic,\" says Fran Bagenal, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder in the US and a member of the Voyager science team. \"If Voyager 2 had left in 1980, it would have taken until 2010 to get to Neptune. I don't think it would have won support. Who's going to fund such a thing?\"\nIt is not just within our Solar System that planet alignments are useful. Astronomers use alignments to probe many different aspects of the Universe, and none more so than in the discovery and study of exoplanets, worlds that orbit stars other than the Sun.\nThe dominant way of finding such worlds is known as the transit method: when an exoplanet passes in front of a star from our point of view it dims the star's light, allowing its size and orbit to be discerned.\nThanks to this method, we have discovered many planets in orbit around certain stars. Trappist-1, a red dwarf star located 40 light-years from Earth, has seven Earth-sized planets that all transit the star from our point of view. The planets in that system are actually in resonance with each other \u2013 meaning the outermost planet completes two orbits for every three orbits of the next planet inwards, then four, six, and so on. This means there are periods where multiple planets in the system align in a straight line, something that doesn't happen in our Solar System.\nUsing transits, we can study the existence of atmospheres on planets like these. \"If a planet with an atmosphere goes in front of a star, that alignment means the starlight goes through the planet, and the molecules and atoms in the planet's atmosphere absorb light at certain wavelengths,\" says Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the Nasa Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology.\nThis allows different gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen to be identified. \"The vast majority of our atmospheric composition analysis is due to alignments,\" she says.\nMuch grander alignments can let us probe the distant Universe, namely the alignments of galaxies. Observing galaxies in the very early universe is difficult because they are so faint and far away. However, if a large galaxy or cluster of galaxies passes between our line of sight with a much more distant early galaxy, its large gravitational pull can magnify the light of the more distant object, allowing us to observe and study it, a process called gravitational lensing.\n\"These are huge alignments across the scale of the universe,\" says Christiansen. They are used by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope to observe remote stars and galaxies such as Earendel, the most distant known star from Earth. The light viewed by the telescope from the star came from the first billion years of the 13.7-billion-year-history of the Universe and was visible only because of gravitational lensing.\nAnd then there are some more novel uses of alignments, such as probing the existence of extraterrestrial life, in solar systems where the exoplanets pass in front of each other from our point of view.\nIn 2024, graduate student Nick Tusay at Pennsylvania State University in the US used these alignments to\u00a0look for any spillover communications\u00a0being sent between worlds of the Trappist-1 system, such as how on Earth we send signals to planets like Mars in our solar system to talk to rovers and spacecraft. \"Any time that two planets are aligned might be interesting,\" says Tusay.\nOn this occasion the searches turned up short. But an alien civilisation looking towards our own Solar System might use similar alignments for the same purpose. While the planetary parade this month depends on your point of view \u2013 any two planets in our system can be aligned if you are positioned at the right angle \u2013 it's not impossible to imagine someone else on the other end, watching on.\n\"Perhaps another alien civilisation might see this as an opportunity to conduct their own investigations,\" says Tusay.\n* This article was originally published on 19 January 2025.

        "article_text": "The Jane Austen-hits-LA comedy changed fashion, language and cinema. As it turns 30 and a new stage musical version opens, its writer and director discusses why it's so personal to her.\nBack in 1995, Clueless offered a cheeky update of Jane Austen's Emma in a Los Angeles high school and, without even seeming to try, revolutionised how we dress and talk. Tartan and preppy chic are still huge (note the blazer and mini-skirt wore by Taylor Swift in London last August, or the pop star's yellow-and-black combo at an MTV awards do in September). Meanwhile, \"As if!\", the catchphrase of its heroine Cher, which originated as a piece of Californian slang, has become ubiquitous. Will you be spared the phrase in this article? As if!\nBecause the film is brightly coloured and revolves around teenage girls, some critics at the time undersold the sharpness of its satire, which targets (among other things) white, west coast privilege, the plastic surgery industry, celebrity do-gooding, taboos surrounding menstruation, the cruelly low wages of teachers, and the kind of Nietzsche-reading liberal male who feels compelled to grow a goatee.\u00a0\nThe popularity of Clueless triggered a rash of insouciantly smart high-school-meets-classic literature movies (including 10 Things I Hate About You, Cruel Intentions, and Easy A, to name but a few). Just as importantly, it started a trend for films and TV shows that focussed on friendships between teenage girls. Thanks not only to the script but also a flawless cast and tip-top soundtrack (so\u00a0much Radiohead), audiences of all ages found themselves rooting for salty protagonists, Cher, Dionne and Tai, who dominate the proceedings in a way that hadn't been seen before in a mainstream US film. Yes, there's a rom-com element to the plot, but it's the tensions between the girls that generate the most heat. Cher's complex interactions with Dionne and Tai paved the way for Buffy and Willow's textured relationship in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Also, not to be bitchy, but without Clueless there'd be no Mean Girls. And Olivia Wilde cited it as an inspiration for her riotous directing debut, Booksmart, itself a modern teen movie classic.\u00a0\nYet 70 year-old\u00a0Amy Heckerling, the film's writer-director, claims she had no idea Clueless would be a hit. \"Nobody is ever sure of that,\" she tells the BBC. \"Well, maybe some people are sure of it. Not me.\" Nor does she know if a new West End musical based on the film, for which she wrote the book, will click with audiences; it is currently running in previews ahead of an opening night in March. What matters, she says, is that she enjoyed working on both projects. She says of the musical, \"It will either work or it won't, but I'm loving doing it.\" As for the film, \"I have to admit, on that shoot I was happier than I've ever been. There were no big prima donnas. It was the closest I've ever come to imagining a movie in my brain and seeing it unfold\u00a0exactly\u00a0how I imagined.\"\nIn the last three decades there's also been a three-season Clueless TV show, a book series, and another go at a stage musical, which premiered on Broadway in 2018. Still, it's the original film we keep coming back to and that Heckerling, Zooming from her home in New York, wants to discuss.\u00a0\nAs in Austen's 1815 novel, the plot revolves around a self-absorbed daddy's girl. Cher (Alicia Silverstone; putty-soft and irresistible) bombs around Beverly Hills with best-friend Dionne (Stacey Dash; poised), obsessed with matchmaking and make-overs. Cher is determined to \"help\" a new girl at school \u2013 dishevelled New Yorker Tai (Brittany Murphy; volcanically beguiling) \u2013 and proceeds to treat Tai like a toy. That is, until Tai fights back and Cher, her mind blown, realises that Tai is her equal. Which is where Heckerling veers off from Austen (whose heroine is ultimately horrified by her protege's \"notions of self-consequence\"). Here's the truth about Clueless. It's not as good as Emma. It's way better.\u00a0\nHeckerling suspects that the film has such a loyal following (and keeps picking up new acolytes) because its \"two princesses\", Cher and Dionne, are so human: \"They rag on each other like real friends do.\" She thinks it's stayed relevant because space is given to characters who \"care about the environment\", including Cher's ex-step-brother, Josh, (played by sexy goofball Paul Rudd) and Cher's Greenpeace-supporting teacher, Miss Geist (a delightfully frazzled but unbowed Twink Caplan). Heckerling says, \"Having those people worry about stuff like that makes the audience relate to them. Well, that's what I've always assumed. I'm not a major activist, but I care about a lot of things.\" Heckerling is also proud of the film's many \"wonderful\" teens, some of them gay \u2013 like the closeted, blazingly charismatic Christian (Justin Walker) \u2013 others broke and scruffy, like lollygagging stoner Travis (Breckin Meyer).\u00a0\nBorn in the Bronx, to an often cash-strapped family, the pale and petite Heckerling has never felt like a top dog and happily acknowledges that her status as an outsider bled into Clueless's sly take on class conflict. She says that when she first went to California, to attend the American Film Institute, people made fun of how she talked. \"They'd go, 'Amy, you want some [she adopts a cartoonish New York accent] quawfee?' Their attitude was like, 'You're talking some old-fashioned, lower-class, New York language. What planet are you from?'\" On the one hand, it was wounding. On the other hand, she wanted to find a way to fight back: \"I didn't feel like I wanted to change how I spoke or who I was.\"\nAmy Heckerling's Five Culture Shifters\nFranz Kafka\n\nFranz Kafka changed modern literature\u2026 OK, maybe Joyce did that, too, but wouldn't you rather read Kafka? It's not even like reading, it's like entering a nightmare with a sense of humour. And I think most adolescents can relate to waking up from troubling dreams to find they've turned into horrible vermin.\nThe Twilight Zone\nWhen I was a teenager, everyone smoked pot daily, except me. I was addicted to The Twilight Zone, and pot made me worry the stories could come true. And some have. In Midnight Sun, it's always 120 degrees (49 Celsius) and the oceans dried up. How brilliant was Rod Serling?\nJames Cagney\n\nI first fell in love with Cagney when I was a toddler. He was a ball of energy, like Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck. When I was a teenager and interested in boys, he was my main crush. In film school, I appreciated his acting and I admire how he led his life.\u00a0\nA Clockwork Orange and 1984 (the books and films)\n\nI'm combining these because what I love is the language. I don't go a day without saying \"Free me glassies\". The future teen slang in A Clockwork Orange (Anthony Burgess) was stylish and thrilling. George Orwell's creation of \"Newspeak\" was genius. The language of 1984 was deliberately getting smaller because without words, there's no thinking, and therefore, no intelligent resistance.\nThat's when she started keeping a notebook of all the new words used by her fellow students and, in the years that followed, any socio-economic tribes she encountered. She says she was especially interested in the \"very\" words \u2013 technically known as adverbs of degree, such as 'totally', 'majorly' and 'way' \u2013 \"because those 'very' words really define who you are, where you live and what year it is\". Which, of course, came in super handy for Clueless. Via the film, Heckerling demonstrates her complete mastery of LA lingo. At the same time, she finds a way to do justice to her own clique, aka earthy New Yorkers.\nClueless immortalises a whole bunch of characters who use Big Apple vocabulary and/or talk with unapologetically broad New York accents; there's Tai, but also Christian, Cher's dad Mel (Dan Hedaya), and a driving examiner (Ron Orbach). Nor is it a coincidence that we're shown a hilarious clip of a \"Bronx-y\" Tony Curtis, looking most uncomfortable in Spartacus (or, in Cher-speak, \"Sporadicus\"). According to Heckerling, Curtis delivers his lines in the way he does (ie at a snail's pace) because he's trying to appear more \"classy\". It's a tactic she's tried herself. \"When you feel kind of insecure about your accent, you try to talk\u00a0more slowly, as though that will get the Bronx out of it.\" The subliminal message sent by Clueless: Don't try to hide who you are. Own it.\u00a0\nSome fans, however, have long believed Heckerling has herself concealed something very important about the film, namely Cher's Jewish identity. It's hard to ignore Cher's Jewish surname (Horowitz), or the mezuzah (a piece of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah) on her family's front door. Yet, until now, Heckerling has been keen to shut down theories about Cher's ethnicity, pointing out that Cher's surname was originally meant to be Hamilton, and that Horowitz came from an ad lib by Wallace Shawn (as Cher's teacher).\u00a0\nHeckerling is proud of her own Jewish roots, and as well as being in love with the Yiddish language (note Dionne's use of the word kvelling), she believes representation is incredibly important. So why, when it comes to Cher, does Heckerling not want to confirm what seems obvious? Whatever Heckerling's intentions when she was writing the script, the character we see in the film is coded as Jewish. If you know what to look for, it's as plain as, well, that mezuzah. Like someone preparing to put down heavy luggage, Heckerling sighs. \"I didn't want to say Cher was Jewish,\" she explains, because \"when you're Jewish, there's always some group that's going to be mad at you\". Another sigh. \"So you don't want to make a big thing of it.\"\u00a0\nHeckerling claims that the most autobiographical scene in Clueless is the one in which Dionne (who, like Cher, has a somewhat kamikaze approach to driving) suddenly finds herself on the freeway and freaks out. Heckerling says that she identifies with the feeling of \"not being a very secure driver and suddenly you're in this situation where cars that are very big are coming right up and honking loudly. You're afraid to change lanes, because your car doesn't have the power to zip in and out and it's very frightening. I would often accidentally find myself on the freeway, just screaming till the exit was there!\"\nThe image of Heckerling in her puny car, screaming her head off, is a comical one, but also feels like an apt metaphor for this film-maker's relationship with Hollywood. Pre-and-post Clueless, she was often made to feel as if she didn't belong in the big league (studios were stingy about budgets; bigwigs tried to bury her projects; she was continually messed around when it came to distribution). Which is crazy. Heckerling is actually responsible for two all-time classic films \u2013 her 1982 debut, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, launched the careers of Sean Penn and Jennifer Jason Leigh and successfully tackled taboo topics like teen abortion. On top of that, Heckerling created the massively successful franchise, Look Who's Talking (inspired by her own daughter, Mollie). The good news is that Clueless, an iconic juggernaut if ever there was one, has allowed Heckerling to keep going. Here she is, 30 years later, still holding her ground and her nerve.\u00a0\nShe has plenty of projects in the pipeline. She and Mollie have written a script for Look Who's Talking 4 and are now waiting for feedback. She's also researching a historical Jewish figure (\"I've made a million notes\"). And she would kill to work with Benedict Cumberbatch. Like her own, dearly departed mother (\"the original Cumberbitch!\"), Heckerling \"worships\" the British actor. \"Whenever I'm feeling crummy I'll put on Sherlock, or the Richard III he did for The Hollow Crown [BBC series of Shakespeare history plays],\" she says. \"I can't stand being in the sun. Or the desert. But if he said, 'Let's do a Lawrence of Arabia remake,' I'd be there.\"\nSerious money has been pumped into the new West End musical. In London, you can't miss the posters, which show Cher, hands on hips, in her yellow tartan suit. Heckerling is pleased with the show because it \"doesn't feel like a different animal\" to the film. \"Some characters have a little more presence than others but, if you like the film, I think you'll feel the show is telling essentially the same story\". Scottish-singer songwriter KT Tunstall, known for hits like Suddenly I See, did the score, while Glenn Slater came up with the lyrics, and their idea has been to create songs that together sound like a 90s mixtape, aping the sound of era-defining acts from Radiohead to Green Day to NSYNC. Heckerling says that she and Slater spent a lot of time working together. \"Me and Glenn would go through the lyrics, with me telling him what the characters were feeling. I'd sometimes tell him, 'Woah, she wouldn't say this!' and changes were made. But, basically, I was so pleased with what he was doing.\"\u00a0\nShe's all too aware that theatre is a different medium. \"In films, you get to do close-ups of people, you can get into their\u00a0brains. In a musical comedy, the characters have to reach the last person in the audience with a song. Hopefully people will like the songs.\"\nThe interview is almost over. So much has changed, Heckerling confides, since she made the 1995 film. She's concerned, these days, about censorship and surveillance, \"I'm worried about how much trouble you can get in to right now. It seems like Big Brother is watching everything you do.\" She calls out, mischievously, \"Hi Big Brother! We're just talking about a silly film!\"\u00a0\nMemories of those \"wonderful\" days on the Clueless set spur her on. She says that many of her friends aren't working and \"don't even\u00a0want\u00a0to be working\". She tuts with amazement. \"It seems very strange to me. I can't imagine not wanting to\u2026\" She searches for the right word, keen as ever to avoid sounding presumptuous or highfalutin. She says, \"I will always want to be\u00a0creating. That's why you're alive, right?\"\nClueless, The Musical is London's Trafalgar Theatre until 27 September 2025.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.\"\nFlack had previously announced in 2022 that she had motor neurone disease, and could no longer sing.\nBorn in North Carolina and raised in Arlington, Virginia, the musician started out as a classical pianist. She gained a full school scholarship to Howard University aged just 15. Her classical training led her into teaching, but at night she'd accompany opera singers on piano, singing pop standards during the breaks.\n\"The whole while I was studying classical music, especially in my younger years, I was also doing a lot of doo-ron-ron, shoo-doo-bee-doo, all of that stuff, with my peers, so I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by music all of my life, the Bach and the Chopin and the Schumann on one hand, and all the rhythm and blues,\" she explained.\nHer recording career started after she was discovered singing in a jazz club by musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known\".\nBut she didn't score her first hit until she was in her 30s - when her recording of Ewan MacColl's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face was used to soundtrack an explicit love scene in Clint Eastwood's 1971 film Play Misty For Me.\nIt was subsequently named song of the year at the Grammys. Flack won the award a second time the following year, for Killing Me Softly With His Song.\nAfter topping the charts again in 1974 with Feel Like Makin' Love, Flack took a break from performing to concentrate on recording and charitable causes.\nShe spent much of the 1980s touring and over the course of her career, worked with artists including Donny Hathaway and Miles Davis.\nIn 1991 she returned to the charts with a duet with Maxi Priest called Set the Night to Music (from the album of the same name).\n She also recorded an album of Beatles covers, called Let It Be Roberta, in 2012.\nAccording to the Guardian, Flack once told a journalist: \"What I consider myself is a soulful singer, in that I try to sing with all the feeling that I have in my body and my mind.\n\"A person with true soul is one who can take anybody's song and transcend all the flaws, the technique and just make you listen.\"\nOnce married, to US jazz musician Stephen Novosel, the star devoted a lot of her time to the Roberta Flack School of Music in New York.\nReverend Jesse Jackson once described her as \"socially relevant and politically unafraid\".\nIn 2020, a year after having a stroke, Flack was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Grammys.\n\"It's a tremendous and overwhelming honour,\" she said at the time. \n\"I've tried my entire career to tell stories through my music. This award is a validation to me that my peers heard my thoughts and took in what I have tried to give.\"\n\nFlack's most famous song was introduced to a new generation of music fans when Lauryn Hill's hip-hop group The Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of Killing Me Softly, which they would eventually perform on-stage alongside her.\nIt topped the charts around the world in 1996.",

That's when Mrs Webb, from Watford, became a fan.\nShe began a business with her husband, Harry, selling the cards online just before the pandemic. During lockdown, it \"really blew up\".\nMrs Webb started making YouTube videos under the name \"PokiChloe\" to reach new fans.\nThe couple joined forces with another Youtuber, Dean Leander - AKA PokeDean - to open a physical business.\nToday her Youtube channel, which mostly shows daily life in her Chorleywood shop, has more than 118,000 subscribers.\nIn recent years, Pok\u00e9mon cards have become valuable collectors' items and many shop visitors hope they too could be sitting on a gold mine.\nLast year, a Nottinghamshire man made \u00a355,000 when he sold a collection of cards from the 1990s and 2000s.\nBut a collector from Suffolk failed to sell his fourth print Charizard card when it did not reach its reserve of \u00a38,000.\nMrs Webb explained: \"It could be anything that makes a card collectable. \n\"It could be that they're rare... It could be that it's a really popular Pok\u00e9mon.\n\"Sometimes overnight prices change on cards and I can't tell you why that card is now valuable.\"\nSometimes cards worth up to \u00a3100,000 have been brought into the shop, although PokiChloe admits the big sums no longer surprise her. \n\"It's going to sound really awful: I'm very used to it now,\" she says. \n\"It is very surreal to think that this little bit of cardboard is worth that sort of money because to some people that's a deposit for a house - that could buy them two or three cars.\n\"But with what we do now we're exposed to it. Often it's just another day and another Pok\u00e9mon card.\"\nMany of the visitors who arrive at Collector's Cardhouse come with large binders tucked under their arms filled with cards they stashed away in their childhood. \nMany of these collections are, unfortunately, not worth anything. \nIf, however, PokiChloe does deem a card valuable, it then has to be \"graded\".\nThe process involves sending the card to a grading company who analyse it for signs of wear and then award it a graded score, usually out of 10, which denotes its quality and potential value.\nPokiChloe compared those cards that get a 10 to \"gold dust\".\n\"It has to be completely clean,\" she says. \n\"There can't be scratches on the holographic part, there can't be any whitening or damage on the back, it can't be creased. It has to be perfect like it's never been touched before.\n\"We had a Charizard that was graded a 10. It was a special card that was given out to employees at Creatures, who own Pok\u00e9mon. I think there's only 300 of them and we had a 10 and we sold it for just under \u00a340,000.\"\nMrs Webb said a common misunderstanding is that a card has to be old to be valuable.\n\"There are packs that you could open today from the shop that cost you about \u00a330,\" she says.\n\"If you got the best card in the set and it was graded a 10, you'd be looking at a couple of thousand.\n\"And they're cards that only came out a few years ago. So they're not even what we would call vintage. They're modern cards.\"\nA graded card, regardless of how damaged it is, is sealed in plastic to preserve its condition. \nMrs Webb said: \"We get people that send off cards that aren't in good condition. They just want to encapsulate it and keep it as a memory. So that's quite nice to see.\n\"I know the money is a big part of it and obviously people are blown away by the prices, but for some people it's about the memories, the nostalgia and just having some memories from when they were kids.\"\nNext year Pok\u00e9mon is celebrating its 30th anniversary. PokiChloe has ambitious plans for the future of Collector's Cardhouse.\n\"I want to keep this growing,\" she says.\n\"If you'd asked me about this five years ago I wouldn't have believed it. I used to work in an office, I had a very normal job before this, and now this is my life... So, as long as people enjoy it, I'm going to keep doing it.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

So, having a European passport, I sort of flew up on his radar. \n\"They offered me a chance to go there and finish my rehab and then playing a couple of months into the season. It was a really good opportunity for me.''\nScotland chasing lost 'resilience' against Dutch\nScotland 'can't make excuses' for Austria defeat\nThomas spent most of her childhood growing up in South Florida, the daughter of a Scottish mother and English father, but it was in France when she began to think she could have a career in football.\n''I saw the opportunity that there was to play while being paid, it just escalated from there and I absolutely loved it,\" she said. \"I was like, I get to do this for a living!\n\"I started playing and started really enjoying myself and that's when I got picked up by West Ham. To go to one of the top leagues in England from Division 2 in France was a huge jump, but it was one I was really excited for.\"\nThoughts of international football were still far off.\n\"I had really low expectations for myself and just wanted to settle in,\" she admitted. ''I was a nobody in a way. \n\"I didn't play for a national team - I came from America. No-one really knew who I was. I just wanted to enjoy myself and see where it got me.''\nIt got her noticed by Scotland head coach Shelley Kerr.\n\"I'd played for the US Under-23 team, but when Shelley called me in, I had just missed that 2019 World Cup window,\" Thomas explained. \n\"I think I was at the first camp straight after that World Cup and, after that, it was sort of no looking back and it didn't feel like a decision for me to make.''\nThomas scored twice on her debut in a 3-0 win over Ukraine in March 2020 and has gone on to score 21 goals in 42 appearances for Scotland.\nShe has moved from West Ham to Manchester United and then on to Tottenham Hotspur, picking up FA Cup runners-up medals with the latter two.\nHowever, qualifying for the finals of a major tournament with Scotland would be a career high.\n''I would be 29 or 30 at that point and that would be the pinnacle of my career if we could get there - and it's definitely what I'm hoping that this team can achieve and strive towards,\" she said.\nA successful Nations League campaign would help that ambition and the side currently led by interim head coach Michael McArdle are already up against it after losing their opener in Austria, before hosting the Netherlands on Tuesday.\n''It helps you have a better chance of qualifying if you stay in League A in the top few positions - it just makes that pathway even better for qualifying,\" Thomas added.\n\"It's what we want. We want to play these top teams and prove ourselves.''\nScottish Football Association",

        "article_text": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us \u2013 but what does AI see in them?\nFor more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality.\nEven if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.\nFor decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.\nYou might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.\nWhile many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations.\n\"When a person interprets a\u00a0Rorschach\u00a0image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\"\nFinding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity.\nBut what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?\nRecent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities.\nWe gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data \u2013 information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so.\nAI v the Mind\nThis article is part of\u202fAI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out.\u00a0\nShowing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be.\n\"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\"\nPretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\"\nThe chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image \u2013 a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched \u2013 perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\"\n\"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.)\u00a0\n\"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.\n\"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking \u2013 instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\"\nWhat we get is a facsimile of reality \u2013 and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says.\nGhosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users \u2013 which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption \u2013 but it can muddy the waters around how they \u2013 and their outputs \u2013 are perceived.\nOne way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation.\nWhen we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses.\n\"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\"\nThat's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered.\nThis is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" \u2013 named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates \u2013 on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted.\nIt is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.\nBut what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker \u2013 in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had \u2013 or created \u2013 a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\"\nWhile this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm \u2013 a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.)\nAI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\"\nAnd that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "On Monday afternoon, a federal judge had a simple question for the Trump administration's lawyers: Is tech billionaire Elon Musk the Department of Government Efficiency's administrator?\nThe agency more popularly known as \"Doge\" is Musk's brainchild, but the White House insists that he is not its leader - or even employed by it. \nJustice department lawyer Bradley Humphreys told the judge that: \"I don't have any information beyond he's a close adviser to the president.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt doubled down on this position at a Tuesday press briefing.\n\"The president tasked Elon Musk to oversee the Doge effort,\" she said, but she later added that \"career officials\" and appointees were helping Musk run Doge, and that people who have \"onboarded\" as federal employees were working at various agencies.\nShe declined to provide specific names, but she announced that Musk would attend President Donald Trump's first cabinet secretary meeting alongside the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General and other top US political appointees who were vetted and confirmed by the Senate.\nThe White House later told the BBC that a person named Amy Gleason is the acting administrator. They did not provide additional details about her or when she was appointed. \nMs Gleason declined to comment, CBS News reported.\nMusk has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings.\n\"They're playing a game,\" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, an organisation that has provided past administrations with procedure and ethics guidance.\n\"If [Musk] were actually the administrator, then this issue about him needing Senate confirmation and his actually having to abide by the conflict of interest laws would be much clearer.\"\nExperts said that Musk has given the impression of being in charge of Doge by staffing the government entity with employees and engineers from his various companies, posting constantly about its work on X, appearing alongside Trump in the Oval Office to promote the cuts it has made to the federal workforce, and representing it on stage at the Conservative Political Action Committee gathering last week while wielding a chainsaw.\n\"We're in Alice in Wonderland right now,\" Mr Stier said. \"We're through the looking glass.\"\nTrump established Doge by renaming the United States Digital Service - an agency focused on digital and web infrastructure - to the United States Doge Service via an executive order.\nThe order establishes Doge's leadership structure, saying that \"there shall be a USDS Administrator\" that reports up to the White House chief of staff.\nIt does not name a specific individual for the role. In fact, Musk's name never appears in the executive order, though Trump has credited his work with the team.\nDoge's arrival has caused turbulence in the existing US Digital Service ranks. The administration fired several staffers there earlier this month, and the Associated Press reported that 21 employees resigned in protest on Tuesday. \nIn a letter to management, they alleged Doge employees were creating \"significant security risks\".\n\"We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,\" their letter stated, according to the AP. \"However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.\"\nBBC News has reviewed the letter but has not been able to verify its contents.\nA series of lawsuits challenging Doge have slowed some of the administration's effort to cut the federal workforce, and they have forced the Trump White House to face the question of Musk's status in court. \nUntil the  administration stated that Ms Gleason was the acting administrator late on Tuesday, it gave vague answers about Doge's leadership across multiple lawsuits. \nThough she did not rule in the hearing on Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly expressed concern about Doge's constitutionality. She noted it might run afoul of the appointment clause of the US Constitution, which sets out nominating procedures for agency leaders.\n\"It does seem to me if you have people that are not authorised to carry out some of these functions that they're carrying out that does raise an issue,\" she said. \n\"I would hope that by now we would know who is the administrator, who is the acting administrator and what authority do they have?\"\nExperts say that Musk's work does not fit the traditional definition of \"special government employee\", which has specific rules.\nThe White House has previously said that Musk \"is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws\". \nWilliam Resh, a professor who studies the executive branch at the University of Southern California, said typically such employees have been hired as advisers for their relative expertise.\n\"But they do not hold distinct executive power the way that a Senate-confirmed appointee would, or even a unilateral permanent appointments that a president can make,\" he said. \nWhile Musk appears to have made several moves regarding the federal workforce largely unencumbered, his recent demand that federal employees list five accomplishments in an email was met with pushback from some Trump-appointed agency leaders.\nThe directive was walked back as optional at some agencies, over concerns staff could reveal sensitive information and that the order violated federal policies.\nAsked whether this showed tension between Doge and Trump's other officials, Leavitt insisted that \"everyone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump\".\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

This is a playbook that many leaders around the world now see as more productive than outright plain speaking or criticism of Trump.\nMacron managed to navigate what could have been a tricky day in Washington without conceding or revealing too much. \nHe spoke of both countries wanting peace, and while he gently corrected one of Trump's claims on Europe's support for Ukraine, he also agreed that Europe needed to take more responsibility for its own security.\nBut Macron did make one important concession \u2013 that Trump was right to re-establish some kind of relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin.\nThat is in sharp contrast to the view up until now in London, Paris and Berlin, which have all pursued a policy of isolating Putin and slapping sanctions on Russian industries and individuals.\n\"There is good reason for President Trump to re-engage with President Putin,\" Macron said, adding that the new administration represented \"a big change\".\nMacron held out the prospect of European countries such as France and the UK being willing to play a leading role in ensuring the security of a post-truce Ukraine, possibly in the form of air power and troops stationed away from the frontline.\nBut at the same time, he stressed the importance of having an American backstop.\nMacron, however, did not get a commitment of US back-up from his meeting in the Oval Office. And if he was looking for a scintilla of criticism of the Russian president from Trump, then he did not get that either.\nWhat he did get was, at least to some extent, Europe's voice back at the table and he, along with other European leaders, will take some heart from that.\nIt is clear however, that the ambitions for re-establishing the kind of close relationship that Europe and the US have had since the end of World War Two are not on anyone's roadmap.\nThat is why Macron himself has been working on the idea of a more strategically autonomous Europe for some time, toying with ideas of combined European defence forces.\nHis sense that Europe needs to adapt given the dramatic shift in the US position is shared by Friedrich Merz, who will be Germany's next chancellor.\nMerz has already said that he believes the US under Donald Trump is indifferent to Europe's fate, and that the continent needs to be independent of the US in terms of security.\n\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said.\nBut France, the UK and Germany have also got to be cognisant of the fact that not all European powers are so hostile to the US view on Ukraine.\nThe rise of far-right nationalist parties in Europe, most notably in places like Germany where the AfD came second in Sunday's elections, suggests some European citizens are also sceptical about the continent's continued support for Kyiv.\nLater this week, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who has been closely co-ordinating with his French counterpart, will come to Washington to reinforce their case on Ukraine.\nHe, like Macron, believes his country has a special relationship with the US which can open doors and get a fair hearing.\nThe problem is that Washington in the shape of Donald Trump is on transmit mode at the moment \u2013 pushing an agenda that leaves little room for the opinion of others.\nAnd while America has always had the ability to flex its muscles and get its way, Europe for the most part has not been on the receiving end.

        "article_text": "A French former surgeon accused of abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children, has told a court that he admits to having \"committed despicable acts\" and \"understands and shares the suffering\" caused to his alleged victims.\nJoel Le Scouarnec is accused of assaulting or raping 299 patients, the vast majority under 15 years old, between 1989 and 2014, mostly in Brittany. \n\"I am perfectly aware that these wounds are indelible, beyond repair,\" Le Scouarnec said, in a halting but clear voice. \nThe white-haired 74-year-old, who wore glasses and a black zip-up sweater over a grey shirt, was addressing the court in Vannes, north-west France, on the first day of the largest child abuse trial in French history.\nWarning: This story contains distressing details\n\"I can't go back, but I owe it to [the victims] and their relatives to admit my actions and the consequences they had and that they undoubtedly will continue to have throughout their lives,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.\nThroughout the day - which was mainly devoted to technical proceedings - he had looked attentive but had no particular reaction when two visibly nervous men in their 30s took the stand to identify themselves as his victims.\nThe youngest of Le Scouarnec's alleged victims was aged one and the oldest 70.  \nPolice were able to identify them thanks to meticulously-compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec is alleged to have logged assaults he carried out on his young patients over more than 25 years.\nHe has already been imprisoned since 2017 for abusing four children, of which he was found guilty in 2020.\nMany of the plaintiffs were allegedly abused while they were under anaesthesia or recovering from surgeries in hospitals across northern France - meaning a number of them had no recollection of the abuse they are said to have sustained, and had to be told by police that their names appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries. \n\"Everything in this terrible story is out of the ordinary... it wasn't the victims that approached the investigators but the investigators that alerted the victims,\" public prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger said in court.\n\"Many of them had no memory... several would have rather gone on not knowing. But silence had reigned for too long.\" \nMany other people, who do remember being allegedly abused, have said the impact of the events has followed them their whole lives, in many cases resulting in serious psychological trauma. \nMauricette Vinet, the grandmother of a patient of Le Scouarnec who killed himself some years ago, told the BBC her grandson Mathis had been \"killed\" by Le Scouarnec's alleged abuse.\n\"If he hadn't happened Mathis would still be here,\" she said. \nDefence lawyer Maxime Tissier told the trial on Monday that Le Scouarnec admitted to the \"vast majority\" of the charges against him and that his client would soon \"explain himself\" with regard to the accusations.\n\"He is a defendant who has made himself entirely available to the court... despite his age,\" Mr Tissier said.\nLe Scouarmec added in court that during his police examinations he did his best to \"admit to the events which constituted rape and those that, in my view, did not\".\nDozens of lawyers were also present in court, but the hundreds of alleged victims they represent were sat in a separate overflow room due to their sheer number. Several psychologists and emotional support dogs will be on hand throughout the course of the trial. \nAude Buresi, the presiding judge, read out a graphic and gruelling summary of the charges against Le Scouarnec, as well as excerpts from his interrogations in 2020, in which the former surgeon initially denied that his diaries reflected real-life abuse and were merely retellings of his \"fantasies\". \nBut Ms Buresi said several elements - including the level of detail and choice of words used by Le Scouarnec - indicated that the diaries were most likely truthful.\nIn his short statement to the court on Monday, the former surgeon referred to his writings as \"very violent\". \nAn hour before proceedings kicked off a few dozen protesters staged a rally outside the courtroom, carrying letters spelling out the phrase \"Stop the code of silence\", while another sign read \"Who knew?\" \nVictims and child advocacy groups have said \"systemic failures\" allowed Le Scouarnec to continue working with children.\nIn 2005, the FBI warned the French authorities that he had been accessing child abuse websites, but this just resulted in a suspended sentence and he faced no consequences in the workplace.\nLater, when Le Scouarnec was working in the hospital of Quimperl\u00e9, he allegedly made sexually-charged comments about a young patient of his, raising the suspicions of a colleague who alerted the regional medical association and made them aware of the suspended sentence.\nThe members of the association were summoned and all but one doctor - who abstained - voted that Le Scouarnec had not violated the medical code of ethics. The BBC has approached the regional medical association for comment\nThe association is now pressing charges against Le Scouarnec for \"bringing the medical profession into disrepute,\" the body's secretary Didier Robin said on Monday.\nHis statement elicited a swift rebuttal from lawyer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Benoist, who represents a child protection advocacy group La Voix de L'Enfant (The Child's Voice) and has previously told the BBC that Le Scouarnec was able to commit his deeds due to \"a huge degree of dysfunction\" among medical professionals.\nMr Benoist said it was \"morally indecent and legally questionable\" that the medical association was allowed to be listed as a plaintiff. \"It is unacceptable that [the association] is sat alongside the victims,\" he said. \nMonday's session closed early - something that is unlikely to happen again over the course of the trial, which will run on a tight schedule and is due to end in June.\nAt the request of the plaintiffs, some sessions will be held behind closed doors - but big portions of it will be open to journalists and members of the public.\nLe Scouarnec's ex-wife and his siblings will be heard in court on Tuesday.\nAsked why she was attending proceedings that will undoubtedly include sordid and graphic details of abuse, one woman queuing to enter the overflow room told the BBC she wanted to see \"this doctor, this Mr Everyman\".\n\"I want to see what human nature can be capable of, because all of this - it's just beyond me,\" she said.",

        "article_text": "Neil McCann, Barry Ferguson and Billy Dodds are back together on the Rangers training ground\nIn beaming up four Rangers men to plug the gaps left behind by Philippe Clement's fallen enterprise, chief executive Patrick Stewart has decided, somewhat predictably, to go where many have gone before at Ibrox.\nThe club's fixation in employing ex-players as coaches hit a new level on Monday. How many Rangers men does it take to change a club? Turns out it's four, albeit as part of an interim collective.\nBarry Ferguson, who has managed Clyde, Kelty Hearts and Alloa Athletic, is head coach until the end of the season. He hasn't held a managerial position since leaving Alloa three years ago. It's fair to say that Ferguson's stellar era at Rangers as a player did a whole lot of heavy lifting in his employment as caretaker boss.\nHe's supported by Neil McCann, a terrific BBC pundit and a big personality. His managerial jobs were at Dundee in 2017-18 and as Inverness Caledonian Thistle caretaker in 2021. McCann is bright and energetic and has been brutally honest in his punditry about Rangers' weaknesses.\nBilly Dodds, another respected Sportsound voice, is a part of the temporary regime too. Like McCann, he's been outspoken on where Rangers have been going wrong under Clement. Of the four coaches, he has had the most success by far.\nAs assistant coach at Ross County, Dodds won the League Cup in 2016 and, as manager, he took Caley Thistle to the Scottish Cup final in 2023.\nThe fourth man is Allan McGregor, a legend of the club in goals but whose coaching credentials are thin, to put it kindly. \nMcGregor has kept a pretty low profile since he retired as a player. He hasn't given off the impression of a man desperately keen to get involved on a training ground, but here he is. Another Bear in the big house.\nGlasgow pressure 'doesn't stop', says Rodgers\nListen: Clement sacking podcast special\n'Rangers locked in vicious cycle as Clement departs'\nFrom elsewhere in Scottish football there will be derision at the old guard being sent for in something of a blind panic. Was John \"Bomber\" Brown unavailable? This is where Rangers are right now, though. \nWith a review of the club's operations in train, a sporting director to find and a new manager to recruit, they have gone to the short-terms option of a Bear Scramble - men who have an intimate knowledge of the club and the league.\nClement's credibility ran out when his team lost to St Mirren on Saturday, a 10th time this season, even outside of Celtic games, when Rangers failed to beat domestic opposition. It was such a limp performance on the back of the loss to Queen's Park that he couldn't hope to survive it.\nThe Belgian is a strong character, but he looked hopelessly diminished on Saturday evening. Booed to the rafters by the supporters, the news of his exit came as no surprise.\nThe Ibrox Four have to pick up the pieces now. Their in-tray must be in danger of  collapsing under the weight of things they must do in order to make their months a success, which, in their position, is a relative concept. What can they achieve ahead of a possible takeover and a new managerial regime moving in?\nBilly Dodds, Allan McGregor, Barry Ferguson and Neil McCann were in the 2002 Scottish League Cup winning squad\nIt's supposed to be fun, but too many of these Rangers players look hesitant and scared, taking easy options instead of doing the brave thing in possession.\nThat's a by-product of pressure and the consequences of failure, so the new coaching ticket had better lighten the mood. The weight of the world appears to be on the shoulders of these players and Clement's day-to-day intensity will probably not have helped.\nThe players look broken. There's a job of coaching and a job of psychology to be done here. They need direction and motivation. \nAs much as tactical issues, they need their heads cleared first. The new coaches need to lift the mood with positivity and energy and hope like hell they can galvanise a beaten dressing room.\nIt's been said that Rangers are a team of moments, which is kind of true. They rely heavily on Vaclav Cerny to do something. If it's not Cerny, it's Hamza Igamane and, if it's not him, then, er, who else is there?\nIgamane is a talent, no doubt about it, but he's gone quiet. No goals in seven games is a terrible drop-off for a guy who scored 10 in his previous 12. He's young and maybe the grim mood at Rangers has got to him, which makes the next point crucial.\nThey can't give them domestic trophies, but they can provide some reason to believe that next season might be better. McCann and Dodds have spent all season pointing out weaknesses in Rangers' defensive structure and in their attacking shape. Now the heat is on them to actually do something about it.\nIt would have been easy for them to stay in the studio and comment from a safe space - talk is cheap - but they've abandoned the safety net and deserve a lot of credit for that.\nThey have to improve players. Clement did that in a blistering start to his time at Ibrox, but he fell away badly after that. \nOnce the interim team moves on, they have to be able to point to numerous players and say that they're in a better place to cope with the strains.\nWhen the managerial team arrive in the summer, they need to have more substantial characters in their dressing room. More leaders. More guys with the confidence to speak and problem-solve mid-game. They're all too timid now. Toughening up the mentality is an achievable goal for the interim crew.\nStephen Robinson's St Mirren signalled the end for Philippe Clement at Ibrox\nIt wasn't games against Celtic - or any on the testing fields of Europe - that did for Clement. It was the relentless toil of trying to break down organised teams who defended deep and with discipline and organisation.\nCeltic nearly always find a way because they have a manager and senior players who have nous. Clement struggled more and more as the season went on. His inability to win games against St Mirren (two defeats), Queen's Park, Kilmarnock, Aberdeen, Hearts, Dundee United, Motherwell, Hibernian and Dundee is what did for him.\nThe temporary coaching ticket need to crack the code of the low block. If they do, the skies will brighten somewhat.\nClement did a terrific job in getting Rangers into the top-eight of the Europa League. An automatic last 16 spot was hard-earned and well-deserved. Those types of games where Rangers were the counter-attacking underdog were the ones that Clement got right.\nThey have Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce next week and the week after. These are Rangers' cup finals now. Fenerbahce have Fred (although suspended for the first leg), Filip Kostic (from the Eintracht Frankfurt Europa League final team), Sofyan Amrabat (of Morocco World Cup 2023 fame), Edin Dzeko and Dusin Tadic.\nKnocking them out would be a massive achievement. It would mean Rangers' season would still have relevance and the caretaker crew would have feelgood and something to build on.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

        "article_text": "Authorities in the southern Indian state of Telangana are racing against time to save eight construction workers trapped inside a tunnel for more than 72 hours. \nAround 50 workers had been working inside the 43km (26.7-mile)-long tunnel, located in Nagarkurnool district, when a part of its roof caved in early Saturday morning.  \nOfficials say 43 of them managed to come out safely but efforts to reach the remaining eight men have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil, mud and slush inside the tunnel. \nThey have also been unable to establish contact with the trapped men, or provide them with oxygen and other essential supplies.\nJupally Krishna Rao, a state minister overseeing the rescue effort, told PTI news agency that \"the chances of their survival are very remote.\"\nOn Monday an expert team of \"rat-hole miners\" - people trained in narrow tunnel navigation - arrived to clear the debris and get to the workers. The same team had sucessfully rescued 41 construction workers trapped in a tunnel after a landslide in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in 2023. \nApproximately 33km of excavation has been completed so far and roughly 10km remain, officials said on Tuesday. \nRescuers are using a train to get to a point from where they need to climb on to a conveyor belt to remove the debris. Reports say they are also continuously pumping out water to ensure oxygen supply within the tunnel. But the rough terrain of the region has slowed them down. \nAs rescue efforts continue, families of the trapped workers - most of whom are daily wage workers - are anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. \n\"I just hope that this time my son comes back safe. I will never send him away to earn again,\" said Rampratap Sahu, a resident of Jharkhand state. \nOthers expressed anger at authorities for letting their family members \"come in harm's way\". \n\"Why did they send the men to work there when they knew of the risks involved in the project?\" asked Jaspreet Kaur, whose brother is among those trapped.\nA portion of the under-construction Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed around 13km from its opening at 8:30 local time (03:00 GMT) on Saturday. \nThe accident took place after a slab of concrete covering seepage on the roof slipped and fell off. At least a dozen workers were injured in the chaos. \nThe tunnel is part of the longest-running irrigation project of the Telangana government. Located in a hilly forested area, it passes through the Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam tiger reserve which is the largest in India. \nOfficials said construction work had resumed just four days before the accident, after a gap of almost three years. \nVarious relief teams, including personnel from the National Disaster Response Force, firefighters and soldiers from the Indian army, are at the spot. \nOfficials told BBC Telugu that a team of firefighters was the first to go inside on Sunday.\n\"We covered 11km by train, 2km by conveyor belt and the remaining distance on foot,\" an official, who wanted to stay anonymous, said. \"But then we hit a roadblock.\"\n\"There were tall mounds of mud and soft soil. The boring machine that was being used by the workers lay upside down, blocking all passage beyond.\"\nThe rescuers said they were forced to return from that point as they did not have the necessary tools and machines to clear the slush. \n\"We shouted and screamed, whistled and pointed torches, hoping for a response but didn't hear anything.\"\nRelatives of some of the trapped men are now desperately hoping for a miracle. \n\"When I left home, my wife held me, wept and said, do not come back empty handed. Bring back my son,\" said Rampratap Sahu, father of one of the workers. \n\"But what can I do? I can only sit here and pray to god to return my son to me. I want nothing else.\"",

        "article_text": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.\nMy mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia \u2013 in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia.\nLike many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics \u2013 the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar.\nSynaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around\u00a060 different types of synaesthesia\u00a0have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types\u00a0experienced in clusters.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures\u00a0might conjure\u00a0emotions.\nSynaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and \u2013 although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental\u00a0and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia \u2013 it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial.\n\"When I was younger\u00a0I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch.\nFrisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical\u2013gustatory synaesthesia \u2013 where words have taste \u2013 explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation\u00a0when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic\u00a0blast.\"\nThis explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much \u2013 that I lost focus.\"\nIt wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange \u2013 and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch.\u00a0\"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\"\nFrisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages\u00a0fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\"\nFrisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".\nJulia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says.\nThe study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without \u2013 skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\".\n\"Specifically, they were significantly better in\u00a0receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\"\nHaving synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\"\nIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.\nThe researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".\nThey then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages.\n\"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' \u2013 or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language\u00a0even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\"\nThe results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn.\nWhen synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense \u2013 for example, both aurally\u00a0and\u00a0visually \u2013 their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern.\nTake 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word \u2013 but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages.\nYou might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool.\nSynaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\"\nHowever, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult \u2013 and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How synaesthesia inspires artists\n\u2022 The AI that 'tastes' colours\n\u2022\u00a0The adventure of raising bilingual children\n\"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes \u2013 the smallest unit of spoken meaning \u2013 evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red.\n\"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours.\nThis double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\"\u00a0explains Bouvet.\nWhether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\"\u00a0\nFor me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n--\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Dmitri Nabokov wrote Wednesday Is Indigo Blue.

        "article_text": "At least six babies have died in the past two weeks in Gaza due to the cold weather and lack of adequate shelter and heating, Palestinian medics and health officials say.\nDoctors at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City, in the north, said nine newborn babies suffering from cold injuries had been admitted, five of whom had died, with one other in a critical condition.\nThe family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight.\nThe PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters.\nThe Palestinian armed group Hamas has accused Israel of failing to allow in agreed amounts of tents, caravans and other shelter supplies during a ceasefire that began five weeks ago. Israel has denied this.\nMost of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times during the 16-month war between Israel and Hamas and almost 70% of buildings in the territory are estimated to be damaged or destroyed.\nThe healthcare system has also collapsed, with only 18 of the 35 hospitals partially functional and shortages of essential medical equipment.\nAccording to meteorological websites, the night-time temperature in Gaza has regularly fallen below 10C (50F) over the past two weeks.\nIt dropped to 3C (37F) on Monday night, after the PFBS hospital's medical director Dr Saeed Salah had warned in a video that three babies suffering from cold injuries, including hypothermia, had died over the same period.\nHe said the babies were only one or two days old, and had weighed between 1.7kg and 2kg (3.7-4.4lbs).\nOn Tuesday, Dr Salah and a paediatrician at the hospital, Dr Samer Lubad, reported that another two newborns had died.\n\"The last several weeks we [had] nine neonates in our hospital. And they came with case that they call 'cold injury' or hypothermia,\" Dr Lubad told Al Jazeera TV.\n\"Three babies survived and were treated successfully and discharged home.

        "article_text": "For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past.\nTheir digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce.\nNow they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC.\nArchaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953\u20133,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent. \n\"The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,\" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University.  \nThe latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as \"Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?\" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure.\nParth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions.  He believes that iron technology likely emerged \"independently in multiple regions\".\nAlso, the \"earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly\". \nIf the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, \"it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records\", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find \"suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world\".\nEarly iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites.\nIdentifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking.\nMost sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron.\nAt burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity.\nSome finds are particularly striking. \nHistorian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th\u201315th Century BC. \nThis advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes.\n\"We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,\" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there \"were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time\".  \nAlso, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community. \nThe furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it.\nTo be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,\" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me. \n\"The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,\" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India.\n\"What's clear now,\" she adds, \"is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent.\"\nExperts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, \"what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,\" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community.\nHowever, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, \"Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu.\"\nKatragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was \"just the starting point\".\n\"We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.\"  ",

Having shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s, he was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.\nBut he retired from acting in 2004 on the advice of his heart doctor, and rarely gave an interview again - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico with his second wife, Betsy.\nEugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, in 1930 and led a peripatetic childhood. \nHis parents divorced, and he was palmed off on various relatives until settling with his maternal grandmother in Danville, Illinois.\nHis father left the family when Hackman was still in his teens. \n\"When young Gene was 13, his father abandoned the family, driving away while his son was out playing in the street,\" reported The New York Times' late writer Robert Berkvist.\nHe went on: \"As his father passed by, Mr Hackman recalled years later, he gave him a wave of the hand.\n\"'I hadn't realised how much one small gesture can mean,' he once said. 'Maybe that's why I became an actor.'\"\nHackman's mother died in 1962 - she burned to death in 1962, after setting fire to her mattress with a cigarette while drunk.\nAs a teenager, Hackman was keen to branch out and lied about his age to join the Marines at the age of 16, serving nearly five years.\nHe was stationed in China where he worked as a radio operator, which led to later work as a disc jockey.\n\"I have trouble with direction,\" he once said of his short military career, \"because I have trouble with authority. I was not a good Marine.\"\nAfter briefly studying journalism and TV production at the University of Illinois, Hackman left to enrol at the Pasadena Playhouse in California in the 60s, where he and classmate Dustin Hoffman were voted the \"least likely to succeed\". \nUndeterred by this vote of no confidence, both actors decamped to New York where they shared a flat with another aspiring thespian, Robert Duvall.\nHackman managed to pick up a few minor stage roles, supplementing his income by taking on a variety of odd jobs. \nHe would often relate the story of how he was spotted by a former drill sergeant outside a New York hotel while he was working as a doorman. \nRecognising his former charge, the sergeant exclaimed that he knew Hackman would never amount to anything.\nThere was also a stint as an overnight cleaner in New York's Chrysler Building, something Hackman later described as the worst job he ever had.\nThere were parts in light comedies both off and on Broadway, which led first to minor television roles and then to some film work.\nHis first movie role was in the 1964 film Lilith, starring Warren Beatty. \nImpressed by his performance, Beatty cast Hackman as his brother, Buck Barrow, in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967.\nHackman received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and was nominated again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.\nBut then came The French Connection.\nIt was the part that made him.\nHe played the part of the maverick narcotics agent Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle who pursues a French drugs dealer, most notably in a famous sequence on the New York subway. \nIt brought him an Academy Award for best actor, and he reprised the role in The French Connection II in 1975.\nGene Hackman never looked back. \nWhether it was for critically-acclaimed movies such as The Conversation and Night Moves, or popular blockbusters like The Poseidon Adventure, he became a reliable box-office draw.\nOne of the great screen tough guys, he effortlessly switched to comedy in Young Frankenstein and played the sleazy supervillain Lex Luthor in Superman and Superman II. \nHackman was so upset about the producers' treatment of the director, Richard Donner, that he refused to take a part in the next sequel, although he later appeared in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\nThe 80s was another successful decade, notably for his appearance in Mississippi Burning, for which he was again nominated for a best actor Academy Award.\nIt was a powerful performance as an FBI agent, tasked, along with a rookie colleague, with investigating the racist murder of black civil rights workers in the early 60s. \nDirector Alan Parker referred to Hackman as \" a very intuitive and instinctive actor\".\nAnother Oscar for best supporting actor came in 1993 for Unforgiven - a Clint Eastwood Western - in which he played a sadistic sheriff, Bill Daggett. \nThe film also won best picture. The awards came three years after Hackman required bypass surgery following a heart attack.\nThere was a leading role as Edward \"Brill\" Lyle, the computer genius in the 1998 film, Enemy of the State, where he starred alongside Will Smith in a frightening tale of government surveillance.\nHackman's hard-edged screen persona made him ideal for the intelligent but ruthless characters in film adaptations of John Grisham novels - such as The Firm and Runaway Jury - in which, for the first time, he and former flatmate Dustin Hoffman appeared on screen together.\nHis versatility, and the luxury of being able able to choose scripts, led in 2001 to another great performance, in the offbeat comedy The Royal Tenenbaums, which drew rave reviews.\nBut he chose to bow out from acting in the political satire, Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.\nExplaining his decision, he told Reuters he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.\n\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"\nA decade later, he did briefly come out of retirement to narrate two documentaries about the history of the US Marine Corps - but otherwise stuck to his plan.\nAfter quitting acting, he gained a new reputation as a writer of historical fiction.  \nHe co-wrote four books with Daniel Lenihan, Wake of the Perdido Star (1999), Justice for None (2004), Vermillion (2004) and Escape from Andersonville (2008). \nHe went on to deliver two solo writing efforts, Payback at Morning Peak (2011) and Pursuit (2013).\nHe spoke about why he had taken to his new job.\n\"I like the loneliness of [writing], actually. It's similar in some ways to acting, but it's more private and I feel like I have more control over what I'm trying to say and do,\" he told Reuters.\n\"There's always a compromise in acting and in film, you work with so many people and everyone has an opinion (laughs). \n\"But with the books, it's just Dan and I and our opinions. I don't know that I like it better than acting, it's just different. I find it relaxing and comforting.\"\n\nHackman married Faye Maltese in 1956. The couple had three children but divorced in 1986. \nFive years later he married Betsy Arakawa, who ran an upmarket furniture store in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nGene Hackman made more than 80 films, and still managed to become both a proficient golfer and respected painter. \nHe was also a mean performer on the racetrack, driving Formula Ford cars and taking part in the 1983 Daytona Endurance Race.\nThroughout his career, he gave few interviews and eschewed the celebrity lifestyle. \n\"If you look at yourself as a star,\" he said, \"you've already lost something in the portrayal of any human being.\"",

        "article_text": "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.\nKetamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.\n\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"\nHe is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.\n\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.\nIn and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.\nAnd the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.\nAn anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.\nThe drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.\nAnd thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.\nNow, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.\nBut some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.\nOne Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.\nThe coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.\nThose on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"\nAcross Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"\nOnce ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.\nThose who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.\nOne mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.\nLexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.\n\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"\nOne reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.\nIn Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.\nTo feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"\nWhat makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.\nAt lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"\nAnd this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.\n\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.\nHigher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.\nThen there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.\nSome of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.\nThe government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"\nFamilies in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.\nIn response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".\nThere is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.\n\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.\nAnd some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".\nIn the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.\nLexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.\nGetting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.\n\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of J\u00f8rn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023.\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it \u2013 the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\u00a0\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018.\nThe judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\u00a0\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A\u00a33.5m or A$7m \u2013 at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 \u2013 the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\u00a0\nBut this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A\u00a312.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\nThe project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors \u2013 the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\u00a0\nUtzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\u00a0\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (\u00a351m).\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The first ever video game console\n\u2022\u00a0How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe\n\u2022\u00a0How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (\u00a333m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him.\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAs a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Bj\u00f6rk\u00a0and Massive Attack. In 1980,\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger\u00a0won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "London Fashion Week - the buzz, the cameras, the bright lights, the glitz and glamour - is a visceral feast for the eyes.\nBut could there be a way for people who are visually impaired to properly experience the spectacle?\nThis year, non-profit organisation Hair & Care created an \"immersive tactile experience\", allowing guests to touch runway pieces and hear detailed audio descriptions.\nDesigners including Chet Lo, Roksanda and SS Daley took part in the initiative.\nJessikah Inaba, the UK's first blind black barrister, said she usually used the descriptions of clothes to create an image of the piece in her mind. \nBut this opportunity led to something she called \"a reverse experience\". \n\"I get to feel the texture, hear the description, and imagine how the written description would capture what I'm sensing.\n\"Chet Lo has been amazing at describing everything \u2014 the colour, the pattern, the material. \n\"It plays such a huge role in helping me really understand and appreciate the garments.\"\nAnother of the guests, student Aleks Tamasauskas, said that although fashion is \"a very visual thing\" the audio descriptions and swatches \"definitely help to paint a better understanding\". \n\"It helps you put one and one together - having a visual impairment means that sometimes you cannot see if something is a dress or a suit.\n\"We were seated right in front of the models so we could see the details and the outfits. \n\"The audio description provided to us was quite well thought out. It gave some explanation of what the models were wearing and the materials used.\"\nLucy Edwards, an influencer and model who lost her sight when she was younger, said she knew nothing about fashion or styling. \n\"The world felt shut out to me. \n\"There was no reference point, no way for me to participate. It felt like my sense of self was ripped away. \n\"For years, I was missing out, but now, with this tactile experience I'm finally able to feel and connect with the pieces in a way I've never been able to before.\" \nThe project is not just about feeling the pieces, but getting a deeper understanding of the inspiration for the clothes. \nThe designers ensured each garment was fully described through audio for the blind and low vision guests, creating a more immersive experience. \nMs Edwards said: \"Hearing Chet's cheery voice on the audio description but also knowing about him and why he wants to create the things he does makes it so much more meaningful and I think that is the gift of blindness. \n\"It brings the catwalk to life. This is the future. \n\"Audio description is simple, it's just an inclusive way to be, it's 2025. \n\"Just learn, just do it, don't be afraid, disability is all around.

Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.\"\nFlack had previously announced in 2022 that she had motor neurone disease, and could no longer sing.\nBorn in North Carolina and raised in Arlington, Virginia, the musician started out as a classical pianist. She gained a full school scholarship to Howard University aged just 15. Her classical training led her into teaching, but at night she'd accompany opera singers on piano, singing pop standards during the breaks.\n\"The whole while I was studying classical music, especially in my younger years, I was also doing a lot of doo-ron-ron, shoo-doo-bee-doo, all of that stuff, with my peers, so I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by music all of my life, the Bach and the Chopin and the Schumann on one hand, and all the rhythm and blues,\" she explained.\nHer recording career started after she was discovered singing in a jazz club by musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known\".\nBut she didn't score her first hit until she was in her 30s - when her recording of Ewan MacColl's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face was used to soundtrack an explicit love scene in Clint Eastwood's 1971 film Play Misty For Me.\nIt was subsequently named song of the year at the Grammys. Flack won the award a second time the following year, for Killing Me Softly With His Song.\nAfter topping the charts again in 1974 with Feel Like Makin' Love, Flack took a break from performing to concentrate on recording and charitable causes.\nShe spent much of the 1980s touring and over the course of her career, worked with artists including Donny Hathaway and Miles Davis.\nIn 1991 she returned to the charts with a duet with Maxi Priest called Set the Night to Music (from the album of the same name).\n She also recorded an album of Beatles covers, called Let It Be Roberta, in 2012.\nAccording to the Guardian, Flack once told a journalist: \"What I consider myself is a soulful singer, in that I try to sing with all the feeling that I have in my body and my mind.\n\"A person with true soul is one who can take anybody's song and transcend all the flaws, the technique and just make you listen.\"\nOnce married, to US jazz musician Stephen Novosel, the star devoted a lot of her time to the Roberta Flack School of Music in New York.\nReverend Jesse Jackson once described her as \"socially relevant and politically unafraid\".\nIn 2020, a year after having a stroke, Flack was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Grammys.\n\"It's a tremendous and overwhelming honour,\" she said at the time. \n\"I've tried my entire career to tell stories through my music. This award is a validation to me that my peers heard my thoughts and took in what I have tried to give.\"\n\nFlack's most famous song was introduced to a new generation of music fans when Lauryn Hill's hip-hop group The Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of Killing Me Softly, which they would eventually perform on-stage alongside her.\nIt topped the charts around the world in 1996.",

I didn't know how to deal with my emotions. It really affected my mental health and I had suicidal thoughts.\n\"Now I've learned to ignore the comments and if I can be bothered, I delete them.\"\nOfcom has previously issued guidance to tech firms around protections for children online and on dealing with illegal online content.\nSpeaking to Radio 5 Live, Dame Melanie said the organisation would \"absolutely\" name and shame companies who didn't comply with their guidance, so the public would know which companies were \"not taking [user's safety] seriously\".\nThe regulator wants sites and apps to adopt these measures voluntarily in what they call \"a safety by design approach\". For example, they could adopt \"abusability\" testing to identify how a service or feature could be exploited by a malicious user.\nRules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force this year, will compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide. The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography.\nContent creator Harriet Maynard has also experienced abusive comments, which sometimes escalate into pile-ons - where a large number of people harass a person online.\nHer Instagram posts are aimed at a female audience and relate to issues around parenthood and lifestyle content.\nDespite having mainly female followers, when a video of Harriet's goes viral, she says she receives \"an influx of negative messages, primarily from men\".\n\"I normally don't let it bother me, but when you get a wave of online abuse, it can get you down.\n\"In a 'normal' workplace, if you were being bullied or harassed, then there'd be an HR department to deal with it accordingly. But for us making content online for a living, there's nothing like that.\"\nNicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, welcomes the draft guidance.\n\"I'm pleased that Ofcom are stepping up to start the process of providing guidance to tech companies to tackle this,\" she said. \"It's now on these firms to implement these recommendations and ensure that perpetrators can no longer weaponise online platforms for harm.\n\"By taking meaningful practical action, not only will people be safer online, but it will demonstrate that tech companies are ready to play their part in tackling domestic abuse.\"\nProf Clare McGlynn, an expert in sexual violence, online abuse and the legal regulation of pornography, says she feels the guidance, which has no legal force, will struggle to make meaningful change.\n\"Experience shows that tech platforms do the absolute minimum necessary to comply with the law and little more. In the current climate, this is unlikely to change,\" she said.\n\"We urgently need to do more by strengthening regulation, making many of these recommendations legally binding. A dedicated Online Safety Commission which prioritises online harms would be a positive next step. \"\nSome of the suggestions to tech companies from Ofcom include:\nWhile a report from Ofcom shows women are five times more likely to suffer intimate image abuse and are more likely to report being negatively affected by harms experienced online than men, Dame Melanie said the guidance was not about \"women versus men or demonising men\".\n\"I think many men are really concerned about this as well. And that wider culture that's going on online, I just don't think it's healthy for anybody.\n\"The misogyny that's becoming normalised in some parts of the internet, that's not great for boys. It's not going to help them to form proper, strong, healthy relationships as they grow up. So I really hope men will get involved in this too.\"\nHarriet believes some of the suggestions by Ofcom would be ineffectual, such as popups on screen to make users consider if they wish to post abusive comments.\n\"I don't think these kind of people worry if they're going to offend someone by doing what they're doing. They hide behind their keypads. Complete cowards,\" she says.\nHowever, she would welcome more protections for women experiencing pile-ons if they were built into social media platforms, adding users should be able to protect themselves from \"pure abuse\".\nMiah feels the guidance may make some difference, if companies choose to follow it.\n\"I'd like to see tech companies do more,\" she says, \"[Ofcom has] a huge challenge, but real change is possible if they hold platforms accountable.\n\"Right now, reporting hate often leads nowhere - there needs to be stricter enforcement and actual consequences for harmful behaviour.\"\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said: \"We remove any language that incites or facilitates serious violence, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.\n\"We continue to work with women's safety groups to understand the different ways harassment towards women can show up, while improving our technology to find and remove abuse more quickly.\"\nThe BBC has also contacted other social media companies, including TikTok and X, for comment.\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, help and support can be found on the BBC action line website.\nRadio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell is being joined by a panel of experts and a studio audience to discuss women and girls' safety online, in public spaces and at home.

Both have been working in the media, primarily for the BBC.\n\"Neil and Billy have got experience of managing at a good level,\" Ferguson said. \"Alongside Allan, they played with the club, know the demands and expectations, so that was important to me as well.\n\"They are bubbly about the place, big characters, like to get in amongst the boys and that's important because the last couple of weeks has been difficult.\n\"It was important I got the right people in. They are not yes men.\"\nIt is almost exactly three years since Ferguson resigned from his last managerial position with League 1 Alloa Athletic. \nHe had been in charge for nine months and left the club eighth in the third-tier table. Prior to that he had spells in the fourth tier with Clyde and Kelty Hearts.\nSince then, Ferguson said he had been enjoying the \"quiet life\", working with Rangers as a club ambassador, and harboured no immediate plans to return to the dugout until this opportunity arose. \nWhen asked if he felt ready to embrace the challenge of such a huge job, Ferguson's response was robust and emphatic.\n\"I wouldn't be siting here if I didn't,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I went down a different route as an ambassador.\n\"Did I want to get back into coaching and management?

        "article_text": "In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsoft's Dublin subsidiary.\nA little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle, where he still works.\nEven though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career.\nMr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving.\nThe verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.\n\"I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,\" says.\nA two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to \u20ac35,000 ($36,000; \u00a329,000).\nBut his take home salary was much, much less.\nHis income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state. \n\"Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.\nMoving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.\nThe money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.\nMr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".\nKeeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.\nIn 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.\nIn 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.\nAfter a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.\nThe proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.\nBut specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.\n\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.\nHe points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations. \nKnown as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.\nThat's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.\n\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.\nMr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.\n\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".\nRita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration. \nAccording to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.\n\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.\nMs de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"\nAntonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.\n\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"\nEven with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.\nNow in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.\n\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"\nMr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.\n\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"\nMr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

        "article_text": "As the new US president makes massive governmental cuts, issues tariffs and leads an immigration crackdown, domestic and international tourism faces unprecedented changes.\nIn the United States, a new presidential administration always comes with policy shifts. But the dizzying speed with which President Donald Trump has issued executive orders and made sweeping federal changes during the first month of his second term has much of the world wondering what the long-term impacts of these changes might be, and what else is yet to come.\nBy threatening and instituting tariffs on longtime allies, moving to overhaul the US immigration system, promising \"mass deportations\" and empowering unelected billionaire Elon Musk to fire thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies established by Congress, Trump has come out swinging in his second act. And while these policy shifts are likely to have far-reaching social, political and economic implications, experts say they will also have a huge impact on the US travel industry.\u00a0\n\"From immigration rules to trade wars, these changes will make travel to and within the US a lot more complicated and way less appealing. It's like putting up a giant 'Do not enter' sign just as the world is getting back into full travel mode,\" said Kristin Winkaffe, founder of travel firm Winkaffe Global Travel. \"If you make it harder for people to get visas, fewer people will come \u2013 it's that simple.\"\nThis already appears to be playing out with the US's northerly neighbour. As Trump continues to threaten tariffs against Canada, even proposing annexing the entire nation, some Canadians have started boycotting US travel. The US Travel Association has warned that a 10% reduction in Canadian visits could result in more than $2bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\nYet, the new administration remains confident that its policy shifts will benefit travellers. \"President Trump has entrusted this team to work tirelessly to reaffirm American's [sic] complete confidence in the safety of our transportation systems,\" newly appointed US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \"Our focus remains on ushering in a golden age of transportation while prioritizing the Department's core mission of safety and delivering innovative projects that move America.\"\u00a0\nWhile the full scale of Trump's policy changes are yet to be seen, experts and travel professionals are keeping a close eye on the specific ways they may reshape travel. We spoke to some of them to find out how these impacts might affect domestic and international travellers.\nPerhaps no mode of travel has been more scrutinised in recent weeks than the aviation industry. In the past month, four fatal plane crashes in the US have led confidence in air travel to drop from 71% of Americans believing air travel is safe in January 2025, to 64% in February, according to a recent AP survey.\u00a0\nTrump's recent policy changes aren't likely to improve this number. Air traffic control staffing was already under pressure nationwide and has been indicated as the cause of near-misses. Yet, even after investigations into the recent crash in Washington DC that killed 67 passengers found that air traffic control staffing was not at normal levels, Trump's administration began firing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees last week. He has also fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Coast Guard, and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, leaving some wondering if aviation safety would continue to be a federal priority.\nThe State Department also suspended all processing of passports with the X identity marker, leaving many non-binary Americans potentially cut off from international travel. More than 15 countries \u2013 including Australia, Canada, Colombia and India \u2013 allow citizens to amend their gender to non-binary or third gender, so it is yet to be determined how these visitors will be treated upon entry.\nIn addition, more than 200 TSA employees have been laid off so far, and many expect screening times \u2013 especially among international visitors \u2013 to go up. Some LGBTQ+ travellers, in particular, are concerned about how recent policy changes will affect air travel.\n\"States like Texas, which is a hub for two of the three major US carriers, are looking at enforcing bathroom use in all public buildings (including airports) along the lines of the binary sex you were assigned at birth,\" said Lindsey Danis, creator of outdoor travel blog Queer Adventurers. \"Trans people would have to choose between complying with a law that would force use of the bathroom that aligns with their former gender or breaking the law and possibly being targeted for being in the 'wrong bathroom'.\"\nWith Trump threatening to tariff Canadian oil starting in March, experts expect gas prices to rise as much as $0.15 per gallon, potentially putting a damper on holiday road trips. Some believe that the president's focus on increasing domestic oil and gas production may temper the effects of tariffs on domestic gas prices, but that may take longer to see at the pump.\nEven those with electric vehicles may have more trouble charging. Earlier this month, the Trump administration paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, a clean energy initiative that had allocated billions of dollars for states to create electric car charging stations since 2021.\u00a0\nThose hoping to drive to or through one of the US's spectacular national parks may also face extra challenges. President Trump recently fired 1,000 national park workers, leaving many to suspect that the staffing shortages will result in maintenance issues, shorter visitor centre hours and fewer amenities for travellers. Yosemite National Park, for instance, has already delayed its summer campground reservations.\nSimilarly, federal funding for train travel seems to be an area that the Trump administration has eyed cutting. As part of recent spending freezes (some of which were temporarily rescinded recently), the US Department of Transportation is under scrutiny, in particular for its rail-related spending. Experts think this is likely to affect the $22bn in annual Amtrak funding, the development of high-speed rail corridors and intercity passenger rail service and grants for railroad safety programmes (which work to improve dangerous railroad crossings).\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The Overseas Highway: The US's 'floating highway'\nIt's not that rail is universally under attack, but some suspect that Trump may be looking to further privatise the industry. \"Right now, there's a bigger push for private companies to take the lead in rail investment, which could bring fresh ideas and innovation but also raises questions about accessibility,\" said public policy advisor Justin Goldsberry. \"Will ticket prices rise? Will service improve, or become limited in certain areas?\"\nThe leisure and hospitality industry is one of the US economy's biggest sectors, employing more than 10% of the American workforce. But policy uncertainty hasn't been good for business, especially from international business travellers.\n\"The US is one of the largest markets for business events (especially exhibitions), and leading US shows rely on a solid share of international and overseas attendees,\" said Kai Hattendorf, CEO at the global business events company HTF and former CEO of UFI The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry. \"Policy uncertainty is disruptive for the sector, as event businesses crave predictability as they are planning years out, working with destinations and all actors from the travel and hospitality ecosystem.\"\nHe points to tech event CES in Las Vegas this past January when visitors from certain countries, including China, were down significantly. Hattendorf is noticing a growing number of events reportedly cancelled due to funding pulled from US government agencies and divisions as they enact new policies.\nOther experts expect that as Trump's immigration crackdown looms, restaurants, hotels and \u2013 by extension \u2013 travellers are likely to feel the effects.\n\"The hospitality industry, one of the largest employers of immigrant workers, will take a direct hit if work visas like the H-2B become more restricted,\" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. \"Post-pandemic labour shortages nearly brought the industry to its knees. If we see another round of restrictions, expect rising costs, declining service and economic losses in major travel hubs like New York, Miami and Los Angeles.\"\nPresident Trump's executive order focusing on \"foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats\" also put visas for foreign nationals in jeopardy. The order directs the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to implement enhanced vetting for both visa applicants and those currently in the country in order \"to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or [its] national interests\".\nThis means delays for those applying for visas, and visa appointments are likely to be delayed or suspended. Legal experts suspect particular scrutiny of those from high-risk countries, and most suspect a similar travel ban as was enacted in 2017 to be enacted once more.\n\"For international travellers, heightened visa scrutiny and extended processing times could mean fewer visitors and billions in lost tourism revenue,\" said Sillaman. \"If the US makes itself a harder place to visit or do business, the rest of the world isn't going to wait. Other countries \u2013 Canada, the UK, Australia \u2013 are already rolling out policies to attract the talent that America risks turning away.\"\nThis could be especially problematic because the US is entering what policymakers are describing as a \"mega decade\" of sporting events. In 2026 the US will co-host the FIFA World Cup in 11 American cities, followed by the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, the Men's Rugby World Cup in 2031, the Women's Rugby World Cup in 2033 and the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2034. Yet, a recent report by the US Travel Association put it bluntly: \"We're not ready to host the upcoming mega decade of events that will draw millions of domestic and international travellers.\"\nAs US Travel Association CEO and president Geoff Freeman writes, slow visa processing times are the \"single biggest deterrent to visiting the US\". According to the State Department, wait times for visitor visas from certain nations such as Colombia can run up to 700 days, making it impossible for many travellers to attend next summer's FIFA World Cup. According to an Oxford Economics study cited in the report, if unaddressed, these days could result in a loss of nearly $19bn in spending in the next two years.\n\"America is staring at a historic opportunity,\" Freeman stated. \"The question is whether we will seize the moment or fall maddeningly short.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.\nMy mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia \u2013 in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia.\nLike many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics \u2013 the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar.\nSynaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around\u00a060 different types of synaesthesia\u00a0have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types\u00a0experienced in clusters.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures\u00a0might conjure\u00a0emotions.\nSynaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and \u2013 although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental\u00a0and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia \u2013 it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial.\n\"When I was younger\u00a0I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch.\nFrisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical\u2013gustatory synaesthesia \u2013 where words have taste \u2013 explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation\u00a0when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic\u00a0blast.\"\nThis explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much \u2013 that I lost focus.\"\nIt wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange \u2013 and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch.\u00a0\"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\"\nFrisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages\u00a0fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\"\nFrisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".\nJulia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says.\nThe study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without \u2013 skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\".\n\"Specifically, they were significantly better in\u00a0receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\"\nHaving synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\"\nIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.\nThe researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".\nThey then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages.\n\"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' \u2013 or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language\u00a0even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\"\nThe results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn.\nWhen synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense \u2013 for example, both aurally\u00a0and\u00a0visually \u2013 their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern.\nTake 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word \u2013 but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages.\nYou might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool.\nSynaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\"\nHowever, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult \u2013 and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How synaesthesia inspires artists\n\u2022 The AI that 'tastes' colours\n\u2022\u00a0The adventure of raising bilingual children\n\"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes \u2013 the smallest unit of spoken meaning \u2013 evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red.\n\"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours.\nThis double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\"\u00a0explains Bouvet.\nWhether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\"\u00a0\nFor me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n--\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Dmitri Nabokov wrote Wednesday Is Indigo Blue.

It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.\nMoving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.\nThe money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.\nMr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".\nKeeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.\nIn 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.\nIn 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.\nAfter a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.\nThe proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.\nBut specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.\n\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.\nHe points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations. \nKnown as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.\nThat's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.\n\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.\nMr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.\n\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".\nRita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration. \nAccording to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.\n\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.\nMs de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"\nAntonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.\n\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"\nEven with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.\nNow in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.\n\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"\nMr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.\n\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"\nMr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.\nGraphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nOn Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\". \nPrior to Stefanishyna's assertion that a deal was close, there appeared to be several sticking points.\nLast Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a reported 50% share of its rare earth minerals - which Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.\n\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.\nThe provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.\nInstead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.\nTrump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.\nHowever, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.\nZelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".\nHe rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\" but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to offering the US access to Russia's rare minerals, in order to counter a potential deal between the US and Ukraine.\nIn a televised interview on Russian state-owned broadcaster Rossiya 1, he said it would include access to Russia's \"new territories\" - those it has seized and occupied in Ukraine since their invasion three years ago.\n\"We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine,\" Putin said, adding Russia was ready to \"attract foreign partners\".",

        "article_text": "Leeds United fans celebrate their second successive comeback win - beating rivals Sheffield United 3-1 at Bramall Lane on Monday\nFor the second time in two days, a set of jubilant away fans celebrated victory at the home of their rivals by belting out the chant \"we're gonna win the league\".\nLike Liverpool fans at Manchester City on Sunday, those Leeds United supporters celebrating a 3-1 comeback win at Bramall Lane over second-placed Sheffield United now believe they will be Championship title winners in May.\nThe symmetry is neat. In 2020, the season halted, delayed and then restarted in front of no supporters because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Liverpool won the Premier League and Leeds won the Championship, returning to the top flight after a 16-year absence.\nDaniel Farke's side are now five points ahead of Sheffield United, who are in the other automatic promotion place, and seven in front of third-placed Burnley. After Saturday's visit by West Brom to Elland Road, 10 out of Leeds' last 11 games will be against teams outside the top 10.\nIn all likelihood, work will be going on behind the scenes to try to make Leeds' next top-flight campaign far different to their last, which ended in relegation after three seasons.\nMaking an impact will not be easy.\nIn the past 15 years, 42% of all promoted teams have dropped back to the Championship in the first season. That rises to 50% in the past decade.\nAmpadu faces surgery in blow for Wales and Leeds\nLeeds stun Sheff Utd with comeback to go five clear\nLatest Leeds United news, analysis and fan views\nFormer Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa remains a legendary figure among fans from their last promotion into the Premier League.\nFirstly, let's deal with the elephant in the room. Marcelo Bielsa.\nWhen Leeds were last promoted in 2020, they did so under the guidance of a man who has assumed legendary status in West Yorkshire.\nBielsa took a group of average players and turned them into a collective force. \nThey shrugged off the heartbreak of missing out on promotion in 2019 by going up the following season and then finishing ninth in the Premier League. \nThey played exhilarating, attractive football and were a joy to watch.\nBielsa's team eventually faded, shattered by the demands placed on it. Bielsa was sacked in February 2022, with the Leeds hierarchy fearing relegation.\nIt was an astute move as Bielsa's replacement, Jesse Marsch, kept them up. But the stay of execution lasted only a year and Bielsa's reputation among supporters remained high. \nFarke accepted the challenge. The former Norwich boss signed a four-year deal in July 2023. His first season ended with 90 points but defeat by Southampton in the play-off final at Wembley.\nMany fans wanted the German out. It was never going to happen.\n\"I always thought he had a two-year window, so I never felt he was in jeopardy,\" said BBC Radio Leeds commentator Adam Pope. \n\"They got 90 points and the basis from which he started was such a mess. Players were agitating to leave and I don't think he knew who was going to be available from match to match. \n\"It was an extraordinary effort to get as far as they did. But this was the year it has felt like it had to happen.\"\nFarke himself will have a point to prove, as well as big question marks over his own Premier League credentials.\nHis Norwich team bounced between Championship title winners in 2019, Premier League relegation in 2020 and promotion again in 2021, before he was sacked 11 games into his second Premier League campaign in November 2021. Farke's top-flight record is six wins from 49 games.\nDaniel Farke won two Championship promotions in three seasons with Norwich\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of Leeds explained the issue the club had on their last three-year stay in the Premier League was that then-owner Andrea Radrizzani just didn't have the funds to kick on.\nRadrizzani's shares were bought by the 49ers Enterprises when they took over Leeds in the summer of 2023, The investment arm of the American football franchise San Francisco 49ers is also attempting to buy a significant stake in Glasgow Rangers.\nThey proved that they have the finance by methodically working through what has been described as the massive 'credit card bill' of instalment payments for transfers from a sizeable churn of players in and out of Elland Road.\nDoubtless they will have a plan for this summer and beyond.\nHowever, there are two issues that are inescapable.\nFirstly, Leeds are hamstrung by the knowledge two seasons in the EFL slices \u00a344m off the maximum \u00a3105m three-year loss limit that applies to the rest of the Premier League.\nAnd beyond that, how much will survival actually cost?\nFor the second year running, the three teams that were promoted from the Championship are looking likely to go straight back down. \nTwo of them, Leicester and Southampton, have far more recent top-flight experience than Leeds. Their struggles prove jumping up from the Championship - even with the benefit of parachute payments - is one thing, but staying there is another matter entirely.\nLeeds clearly need at least one striker. They sold Georginio Rutter to Brighton for \u00a340m in August, which sets a benchmark for a decent Premier League forward. \nWhen you start adding in creative midfielders, full-backs and a goalkeeper - Illan Meslier added another mistake to this season's 'crime sheet' by scoring an own goal to give Sheffield United the lead on Monday - the millions rack up.\nTwo of Farke's mainstays, Joe Rothwell and Manor Solomon, are on loan and will need to be bought or replaced, so the bill for a decent shot at survival is going to be astronomical.\nElland Road has been Leeds United's home since the club was formed in 1919\nOne way of paying for this would be to generate greater revenue from Leeds' vast fanbase.\nPlans are already in place to expand the dated Elland Road stadium from its current 38,000 capacity by redeveloping the West Stand and the Revie Stand to eventually take the capacity to 55,000.\nThe aim is to use the same model as Liverpool, whose work on the Anfield Road stand was done by building over the top of the existing structure.\nBut this work will not be cheap. Leeds need to be in the Premier League before club chiefs press ahead.\nFor Leeds' financial executives, a delicate balance needs to be navigated between ploughing resource into infrastructure and Farke's squad. Ideally, it should be a twin track process and fans understand that.\nAfter Monday's match, I asked Farke if he felt an \"obligation\" to take Leeds back to the Premier League.\nHe said not. But the answer was revealing.\n\"In the last 25 years, we were promoted to the Premier League once and had three seasons in it, one outstanding season for Marcelo and two difficult ones, including a relegation,\" he said.\n\"At the moment, you are not allowed to label us as an established Premier League side. This is what I want to change.\n\"It is good for us to stay humble. At this club, after a win, everyone speaks about Europe, after a loss, people are saying we will probably go down to League Two. That is what these clubs are all about.\n\"It is a great honour to be in this chair at this amazing club. It is a great responsibility but it comes with pressure. \n\"Everyone expects us to win. That is what Leeds is all about.\"\nLatest Leeds United news, analysis and fan views\nListen to the latest Don't Go To Bed Just Yet podcast",

The organisation \"could face financial ruin, ending over 50 years of environmental activism\" if it loses, it also says.\nThe trial in North Dakota is expected to last five weeks, beginning with jury selection on Monday.\nThe lawsuit, filed in state court, accuses Greenpeace of an \"unlawful and violent scheme to cause financial harm to Energy Transfer, physical harm to its employees and infrastructure, and to disrupt and prevent Energy Transfer's construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline\".\nGreenpeace says it could be forced into bankruptcy if it is ordered to pay the approximate $300m (\u00a3237m)  in claimed damages.\nEnergy Transfer brought a similar federal lawsuit in 2017,  arguing protesters had violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico) - an allegation more often made against organised crime groups. A judge dismissed the case.\nBut this trial is taking place in conservative North Dakota. \nThe state's former governor, Doug Burgum, is currently leading the federal agency on public lands for the Trump administration, as the secretary for the Department of Interior. Greenpeace has expressed concern that it cannot get a fair hearing in the oil-rich area.\nThe pipeline's construction gained international attention during Trump's first term as Native American groups set up an encampment trying to block it from passing near Standing Rock. The protests started in April 2016, and ended in February 2017, when the National Guard and police cleared the protest site.\nAt the peak, over 10,000 protesters were on site. The group included more than 200 separate Native American tribes, hundreds of US military veterans, actors and political leaders -  including the current health secretary, Robert F Kennedy, Jr.\nHundreds were arrested, and authorities were accused of using excessive force, including dousing crowds with pepper spray and freezing water as well as firing sound cannons, bean-bag rounds and rubber bullets.\nLawyers for Greenpeace argue that it was not the leader of the protest group, but helped support \"nonviolent, direct-action training\" to protesters. \nThe suit names Greenpeace USA, as well as its Washington DC-based funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc and its Amsterdam-based parent group Greenpeace International.\nGreenpeace has sued Energy Transfer (ET) in Dutch court, claiming that the company is attempting to unfairly use the legal system to silence critics.\nThe lawsuit, filed earlier this month, seeks to recover \"all damages and costs it has suffered as a result of ET's back-to-back, meritless lawsuits\".",

Ireland overcame Wales in Cardiff and England squeezed past Scotland at Allianz Stadium.\nBBC's Rugby Union Weekly pundits have had their say on who Lions head coach Andy Farrell will be keeping his eye on.\nFormer Lions captain Sam Warburton also gives his thoughts on who should be the squad's captain.\nPick your Lions XV in the comments section below.\nThe Calcutta Cup  - a fixture Scotland fly-half Finn Russell has lit up in recent years - was seen as a perfect opportunity for the two-time Lion to restate his credentials as the starting fly-half.\nRussell, especially in the opening half, looked back to his old self as he helped pick apart England's defence with his wide passing game.\nHowever, Gregor Townsend's side failed to capitalise on their dominance and came up short 16-15, with Russell missing all three kicks he had at goal - including a last-gasp match-winning conversion from the corner.\nDespite kicking at 38% in this year's Six Nations, former Scotland captain John Barclay is not concerned and still backs 32-year-old Russell to start.\n\"I still think Finn Russell [is in pole position],\" Barclay told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"I am not bothered about his kicking. His kicking last year and across the season for Bath has been great. He is a good kicker.\n\"It was the best he has played in the championship. Look at how he got Scotland's backline moving with his passing game. And his kicking game was good too.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'Russell's goal kicking massively disappointing so far'\nEngland fly-half Fin Smith backed up his player-of-the-match performance in round two with another assured display.\nThe Northampton Saint is 10 years younger than Russell and stepped up to kick a pressure penalty from halfway to continue his bid for a spot as one of Farrell's fly-halves.\nIreland fly-half Sam Prendergast, who recently turned 22, is the least experienced contender and won only his sixth cap in Cardiff.\nIreland remain on course for a Grand Slam after Prendergast, who kicked 17 points, helped guide them through a tricky spell when Garry Ringrose was given a 20-minute red card in the 34th minute.\nA particular standout moment came when he spiralled a 50-22 over the head of replacement Wales fly-half Jarrod Evans. The execution was \"utter filth\", according to Barclay.\nHaving backed up his player-of-the-match performance against Scotland, Warburton believes Prendergast has edged into top spot.\n\"Without putting too much pressure on him, I see a world-class top-level 10,\" Warburton told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"You just watch him play and you think 'he is Test level'.

I will go for Hugo Keenan as someone who is just really safe at the back.\"\nEngland wing Tommy Freeman has scored a try in all three rounds this campaign, and showed his power to crash over against Scotland from close range.\nFormer England wing Ugo Monye believes he is a \"dark horse\" to go on tour, with his ability to play centre also enhancing his chances.\n\"I am not sure why he is not in many Lions conversations. His error count is so low and aerially he is so brilliant,\" Monye told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"He scored England's only try against Scotland, and changed the game against France with his aerial game to get above Louis Bielle-Biarrey [for his try].\"\nThis video can not be played\nSix Nations Rugby Special: How 'superb' Ireland turned it around\nEngland captain Maro Itoje led from the front by producing crucial turnovers to help his side win back the Calcutta Cup for the first time since 2020.\nThe 30-year-old second row took over as skipper from Jamie George before the Six Nations and is a two-time Lion with six appearances in Tests.\nFormer England scrum-half Matt Dawson told Rugby Union Weekly that Itoje, who in 2021 was voted by his team-mates as player of the series in South Africa, has \"some super-human tendencies\" which could make him a Lions captain.\n\"All of a sudden it feels like he has become the player we all thought he was going to be when he has got the armband on,\" Dawson added.\nNumber eight Caelan Doris missed his side's win over Wales because of injury, but given Farrell made him Ireland captain in 2024 is in a strong position.\nWarburton says any of Doris, Itoje or Wales captain Jac Morgan would make a strong Lions captain, but is leaning towards Itoje.\n\"Doris is definitely captaincy-worthy but the number one criteria for your captain has got to be that he is a banker to start, and I think there are some really good number eights,\" Warburton added.\n\"On form, who is inked in and who has worked with Farrell on Lions tours before?

        "article_text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim during the 2-2 draw at Everton on 22 February\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he and his players must take some responsibility for the club's present financial predicament.\nSpeaking less than 24 hours after United confirmed a second round of redundancies that will lead to up to 200 staff members losing their jobs, Amorim said that, as the \"engine\" of the club, his squad must do better.\nAfter losing more than \u00a3300m in the past five years, United find themselves 15th in the Premier League before their encounter with relegation-threatened Ipswich at Old Trafford on Wednesday.\nIt is their worst league campaign since the dark days of 1989-90, when Sir Alex Ferguson almost got the sack as United flirted with the relegation zone before eventually finishing 13th.\n\"We have to address all the problems in the club but one important piece of this moment is to understand how we get to this situation,\" said Amorim. \n\"It has a lot to do with the lack of success of the football team because we are the engine of any football club.\"\nIn the space of under two seasons, United have fallen from a third-place finish in Erik ten Hag's first season in charge to their current position.\nWhile Amorim and his squad might be insulated from the cost-cutting measures - staff at Old Trafford will no longer get free lunches in a move the club estimates will save \u00a31m - some of the people they work with every day will soon no longer be around.\n\"We know this year was really hard for everybody,\" said Amorim, who replaced Ten Hag in November.\n\"As a club, we did a lot of changes. When you are doing the changes if you have a football team who are playing well and winning games, it is easier for the fans and everyone to feel that. But in this moment we are in a difficult period inside of the club and inside of the pitch. We have to fight against this feeling.\n\"We have do our job and we try our best to help the team to perform better.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'I feel sorry for Rasmus Hojlund' - Troy Deeney\nUnited have scored 30 goals from 26 league games so far this season, with Rasmus Hojlund managing just two from 15 league starts.\nThe 22-year-old Denmark striker, who was signed from Atalanta for \u00a372 in August 2023, has scored seven goals in all competitions, with his last strike coming in the Europa League against Viktoria Plzen on 12 December.\n\"I think it's clear, we as a team, we are not helping Rasmus,\" Amorim added. \"We don't create a lot of chances.\n\"I think Rasmus has a lot of potential. If we improve the way we play the game, he will have more opportunities to score.\n\"He came here very young and, when you are very young, to be the number nine and play all the time sometimes is hard.\n\"We have to look at Rasmus as a player: he has the pace, he has the technique, he scores some goals that are really hard to score.\n\"Sometimes he doesn't choose the better runs, sometimes he's so anxious to touch the ball because he passes long minutes without the ball and he moves away from the goal.\n\"We address that in training.

        "article_text": "\"I swear to God I need help,\" said the man quietly on the other end of the line.\nThe Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand.\nThey are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.\nBut many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow. \nThe armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people \u2013 more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.\nThe BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.\nHe told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.\nMike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills.\nInstead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.\n\"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.\"\nMike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar. \nDespite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.\nChina, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.\nAriyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.\nHe showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.\n\"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.\"\nAriyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well. \nHe says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.\nThe release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border. \nIt limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.\nThat hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.\nThe camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community. \nUntil recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.\nThailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home. \nA group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.\nThe problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok. \nThe BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.\nThailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.\nDifferent ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.\n\"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it \u2013 we must work seriously,\" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.\n\"Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,\" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.\n\"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough.\"\nThailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them.\nBut that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them.\nMike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave. \nOn Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital.\n\"I just want to go home,\" he said over the phone. \"I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.\"",

        "article_text": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.\nMy mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia \u2013 in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia.\nLike many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics \u2013 the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar.\nSynaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around\u00a060 different types of synaesthesia\u00a0have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types\u00a0experienced in clusters.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures\u00a0might conjure\u00a0emotions.\nSynaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and \u2013 although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental\u00a0and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia \u2013 it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial.\n\"When I was younger\u00a0I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch.\nFrisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical\u2013gustatory synaesthesia \u2013 where words have taste \u2013 explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation\u00a0when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic\u00a0blast.\"\nThis explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much \u2013 that I lost focus.\"\nIt wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange \u2013 and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch.\u00a0\"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\"\nFrisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages\u00a0fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\"\nFrisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".\nJulia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says.\nThe study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without \u2013 skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\".\n\"Specifically, they were significantly better in\u00a0receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\"\nHaving synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\"\nIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.\nThe researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".\nThey then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages.\n\"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' \u2013 or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language\u00a0even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\"\nThe results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn.\nWhen synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense \u2013 for example, both aurally\u00a0and\u00a0visually \u2013 their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern.\nTake 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word \u2013 but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages.\nYou might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool.\nSynaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\"\nHowever, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult \u2013 and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How synaesthesia inspires artists\n\u2022 The AI that 'tastes' colours\n\u2022\u00a0The adventure of raising bilingual children\n\"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes \u2013 the smallest unit of spoken meaning \u2013 evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red.\n\"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours.\nThis double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\"\u00a0explains Bouvet.\nWhether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\"\u00a0\nFor me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n--\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Dmitri Nabokov wrote Wednesday Is Indigo Blue.

        "article_text": "To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.\nThis part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.\nBut Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain. \nAs well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.\nA decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.\nIS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.\nKurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.\nAt the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).\n\nAs we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.\nBut in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.\nFor the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. \"Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,\" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. \"It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.\"\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.\nTurkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.\nTurkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.\nAs the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.\nNow battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: \"Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.\"\nIn the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.\nNewrouz Ahmad says that having \"defeated IS in Kobane\u2026 we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too\".\nAt a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. \"I am 60,\" he says.\nIt's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.\nAnd now the threat of another battle is looming.\nTurkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.\nIn a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.\nShe shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.\nThe protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing.  The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.\n\"An old man next to me was also injured,\" she tells me from her bed.\n\"I lost some blood\u2026 but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,\" she adds.\nHuman Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an \"apparent war crime\" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.\nThe Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that \"reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth\" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a \"conflict-ridden area on purpose\" to use them as \"human shields\u2026 in order to not to lose control on the said dam\".\nIt accused the SDF of using \"violence and terror\" to pursue \"its own separatist agenda\", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.\nSyria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.\nThe interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.\nBut the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies \u2013 Turkey.\nAnd when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.\nSpeaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.\nBut the two sides have still not reached an agreement.\n\"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,\" he says, adding: \"In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.\n\"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,\" he says.\nFor the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.\nToday, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.\nBut the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.\nIt's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.\n\"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,\" he warns. \"That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.\"\nThere is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.\nThe walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.\n\"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,\" she says. \"Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?\"\nMs Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.\n\"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?\" she asks.\nSo while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?",

        "article_text": "US government workers faced widespread confusion on Monday following conflicting advice over compliance with an Elon Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination.\nJust 48 hours after an email asking \"what did you do last week?\" was sent, the office behind it clarified responses were voluntary, leaving agencies to decide their approach.\nBut as this new guidance was shared with federal agencies, President Donald Trump weighed in that workers who did not comply with Mr Musk's demand would be fired or \"sort of semi-fired\".\nAnd later on Monday evening, Mr Musk reinforced the ultimatum, granting workers a final chance to respond. \nThe mail from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on Saturday, instructed recipients to reply with five examples of what they did over the past seven days, without revealing any classified information. The recipients were asked to respond by  end of Monday.\nMr Musk, who is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), said that  failure to respond would be taken as a resignation. \nThe comments fuelled backlash, with federal worker unions and activist groups filing a lawsuit in California to halt the email mandate.\nKey agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, and the FBI\u2014now led by Trump appointees\u2014instructed employees to ignore the directive.

        "article_text": "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not. \nThe Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.\nAwards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.\nAhead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.\n1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.\nWicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.\nThe musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.\n2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.\nThe US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.\nBut Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.\nOnly seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.\n3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat. \nThe Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. \nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.\n4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.\nIt might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins. \nEmilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.\nOnly one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall. \n5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.\nKieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.\nBut the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.\nA Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.\nEvery actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.\n6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.\nThe other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.\nThe Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race. \n7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.\nBeatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.\nDame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.\nWinners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.\nOn the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.\n8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.\nQuite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.\nJust behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.\nBradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.\n9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.\nThat might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.\nThe historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize. \nBut that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.\n10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.\nFrank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.\nSam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.\nPerhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.\nStan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.\n11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.\nThe British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.\nIts prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.\n12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.\nThe last two times the British star was nominated for best actor, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture. \nIf Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).\nHowever, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.\nOn the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.\nWhy wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.\n13. Diane Warren really wants to win.\nThe songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.\nBut Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?\nShe certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"\n14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.\nIt did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.\nThe last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.\n15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.\nI'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.\nMeanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.\n16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.\nAs Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.\nNobody has ever done this before.\nWalt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films. \nAnd Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.\nIf Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.\nAnora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.\n17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.\nThe delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes. \n\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat. \n\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

I didn't know how to deal with my emotions. It really affected my mental health and I had suicidal thoughts.\n\"Now I've learned to ignore the comments and if I can be bothered, I delete them.\"\nOfcom has previously issued guidance to tech firms around protections for children online and on dealing with illegal online content.\nSpeaking to Radio 5 Live, Dame Melanie said the organisation would \"absolutely\" name and shame companies who didn't comply with their guidance, so the public would know which companies were \"not taking [user's safety] seriously\".\nThe regulator wants sites and apps to adopt these measures voluntarily in what they call \"a safety by design approach\". For example, they could adopt \"abusability\" testing to identify how a service or feature could be exploited by a malicious user.\nRules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force this year, will compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide. The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography.\nContent creator Harriet Maynard has also experienced abusive comments, which sometimes escalate into pile-ons - where a large number of people harass a person online.\nHer Instagram posts are aimed at a female audience and relate to issues around parenthood and lifestyle content.\nDespite having mainly female followers, when a video of Harriet's goes viral, she says she receives \"an influx of negative messages, primarily from men\".\n\"I normally don't let it bother me, but when you get a wave of online abuse, it can get you down.\n\"In a 'normal' workplace, if you were being bullied or harassed, then there'd be an HR department to deal with it accordingly. But for us making content online for a living, there's nothing like that.\"\nNicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, welcomes the draft guidance.\n\"I'm pleased that Ofcom are stepping up to start the process of providing guidance to tech companies to tackle this,\" she said. \"It's now on these firms to implement these recommendations and ensure that perpetrators can no longer weaponise online platforms for harm.\n\"By taking meaningful practical action, not only will people be safer online, but it will demonstrate that tech companies are ready to play their part in tackling domestic abuse.\"\nProf Clare McGlynn, an expert in sexual violence, online abuse and the legal regulation of pornography, says she feels the guidance, which has no legal force, will struggle to make meaningful change.\n\"Experience shows that tech platforms do the absolute minimum necessary to comply with the law and little more. In the current climate, this is unlikely to change,\" she said.\n\"We urgently need to do more by strengthening regulation, making many of these recommendations legally binding. A dedicated Online Safety Commission which prioritises online harms would be a positive next step. \"\nSome of the suggestions to tech companies from Ofcom include:\nWhile a report from Ofcom shows women are five times more likely to suffer intimate image abuse and are more likely to report being negatively affected by harms experienced online than men, Dame Melanie said the guidance was not about \"women versus men or demonising men\".\n\"I think many men are really concerned about this as well. And that wider culture that's going on online, I just don't think it's healthy for anybody.\n\"The misogyny that's becoming normalised in some parts of the internet, that's not great for boys. It's not going to help them to form proper, strong, healthy relationships as they grow up. So I really hope men will get involved in this too.\"\nHarriet believes some of the suggestions by Ofcom would be ineffectual, such as popups on screen to make users consider if they wish to post abusive comments.\n\"I don't think these kind of people worry if they're going to offend someone by doing what they're doing. They hide behind their keypads. Complete cowards,\" she says.\nHowever, she would welcome more protections for women experiencing pile-ons if they were built into social media platforms, adding users should be able to protect themselves from \"pure abuse\".\nMiah feels the guidance may make some difference, if companies choose to follow it.\n\"I'd like to see tech companies do more,\" she says, \"[Ofcom has] a huge challenge, but real change is possible if they hold platforms accountable.\n\"Right now, reporting hate often leads nowhere - there needs to be stricter enforcement and actual consequences for harmful behaviour.\"\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said: \"We remove any language that incites or facilitates serious violence, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.\n\"We continue to work with women's safety groups to understand the different ways harassment towards women can show up, while improving our technology to find and remove abuse more quickly.\"\nThe BBC has also contacted other social media companies, including TikTok and X, for comment.\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, help and support can be found on the BBC action line website.\nRadio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell is being joined by a panel of experts and a studio audience to discuss women and girls' safety online, in public spaces and at home.

        "article_text": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us \u2013 but what does AI see in them?\nFor more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality.\nEven if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.\nFor decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.\nYou might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.\nWhile many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations.\n\"When a person interprets a\u00a0Rorschach\u00a0image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\"\nFinding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity.\nBut what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?\nRecent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities.\nWe gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data \u2013 information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so.\nAI v the Mind\nThis article is part of\u202fAI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out.\u00a0\nShowing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be.\n\"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\"\nPretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\"\nThe chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image \u2013 a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched \u2013 perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\"\n\"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.)\u00a0\n\"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.\n\"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking \u2013 instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\"\nWhat we get is a facsimile of reality \u2013 and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says.\nGhosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users \u2013 which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption \u2013 but it can muddy the waters around how they \u2013 and their outputs \u2013 are perceived.\nOne way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation.\nWhen we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses.\n\"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\"\nThat's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered.\nThis is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" \u2013 named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates \u2013 on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted.\nIt is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.\nBut what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker \u2013 in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had \u2013 or created \u2013 a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\"\nWhile this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm \u2013 a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.)\nAI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\"\nAnd that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Only three Premier League goalkeepers - Ipswich's Arijanet Muric, Robert Sanchez of Chelsea and Brighton's Bart Verbruggen - have made more errors leading to goals this season than Andre Onana\nManchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana is in the spotlight again after his error led to Ipswich Town taking an early lead in their Premier League game on Wednesday evening. \nUnited rallied and eventually won the game 3-2 despite being down to 10 men, but the mistake has reignited the debate about the Cameroon international.\nThe 28-year-old endured a tough start to life at Old Trafford but appeared to have turned a corner earlier this season when he had the most clean sheets in England's top flight with six. \nHowever, four minutes in to the game against the Tractor Boys, he illustrated why United fans and pundits have persistent doubts about him.\nHe dashed to the edge of his penalty area as Patrick Dorgu ran towards him and, as the left wing-back nudged the ball towards where he expected Onana to be, it gifted Jaden Philogene with a tap-in.\nThe former Aston Villa winger later scored his second of the night from a deep cross that deceived Onana because of Liam Delap's run across him.\nSpeaking on TNT Sports, former Blackburn and Wales midfielder Robbie Savage said: \"I've got no idea why Onana is running out to that position [for the first goal]. \n\"Dorgu has got it under control, no problem at all. He shouldn't come there.\n\"You should be talking, lay it back to him on his right foot and then he can clear it. I don't know why he's come.\" \nFormer United defender Rio Ferdinand added: \"It was a terrible start. Onana doesn't need to come. The full-back is in complete control and he can just hold his ground and let him play it back to him.\"\nOn BBC Radio 5 Live, former Celtic boss Neil Lennon added: \"I don't know where Andre Onana is going. It is a shambles.\"\nUnited paid \u00a347m to sign Onana from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023 as a  replacement for four-time club player of the year David de Gea.\nBut he has largely failed to shake the view that his occasional fallibility adds to the fragility of a struggling side.\nOnana made several glaring mistakes in the Champions League last term that contributed heavily to United's early exit from the competition at the group stage. \nThere had already been notable errors against Viktoria Plzen, Brighton and Nottingham Forest this season prior to the Ipswich game as he has slipped down in the race for the Golden Glove.\nHis performance in the 1-0 defeat at Tottenham, where he pushed Lucas Bergvall's tame effort straight into the path of goalscorer James Maddison, encouraged further scrutiny.\nHis understudy, Turkey's Altay Bayindir, has played just seven times since joining in September 2023 and is yet to start a Premier League game. \nOnana's form and the reluctance to use Bayindir prompts questions about the decision to let De Gea, Dean Henderson and Czech Republic goalkeeper Matej Kovar to leave for less than half the amount Inter were paid for their goalkeeper.\nDe Gea, 34, who has won 45 caps for Spain and is now at Fiorentina in Serie A, is the obvious barometer. \nHe has a better shot save percentage than Onana - 72 compared to 65 - and has yet to make any big errors directly leading to goals, compared to three for Onana.\nIn mitigation, De Gea has faced fewer shots (90 to 111) and Onana has also had to contend with a switch in formation from 4-3-3 to 3-4-3 under a new manager in Ruben Amorim. \nThe Portuguese boss is also yet to name an unchanged starting XI in any of the 23 matches he has taken charge of and has had a habit of substituting one of his three central defenders after about an hour.\nThat can hardly help build relationships and understanding at the back and nor can Onana be blamed for some of the static defending in front of him.\nIt should also be noted Onana has at times made crucial saves this season.\nWhat's more, Fiorentina are in better form than United, challenging for a Champions League spot in Italy while United are a lowly 14th in the Premier League.\nHowever, a perhaps surprising statistic against Onana centres around passing accuracy, given he was brought in as the calatyst towards a possession-based style of play. \nDe Gea was not noted for his dexterity with his feet but trails Onana by just 1%, although he has made significantly fewer passes. His pass completion statistics in his final season at United (73%) were also higher than Onana's this year.\nFormer United goalkeeper Massimo Taibi, whose famous howler against Southampton in 1999 hastened his own departure from Old Trafford, believes Onana could be on borrowed time.\n\"I think subconsciously the United environment isn't ideal for him and when a marriage is showing cracks, it's pointless to continue,\" he told the Sun in December. \n\"I'd be straight to the point and tell him, 'Andre, you are one of the best keepers in Europe but in the Premier League, you are under-performing. Block out criticism, do some soul-searching, press the reset and go again. And if things don't change by June, move on'.\"\nOnana will perhaps be wondering if his latest error will lead to his exit from Old Trafford after just two seasons in Manchester.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us \u2013 but what does AI see in them?\nFor more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality.\nEven if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.\nFor decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.\nYou might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.\nWhile many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations.\n\"When a person interprets a\u00a0Rorschach\u00a0image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\"\nFinding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity.\nBut what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?\nRecent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities.\nWe gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data \u2013 information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so.\nAI v the Mind\nThis article is part of\u202fAI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out.\u00a0\nShowing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be.\n\"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\"\nPretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\"\nThe chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image \u2013 a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched \u2013 perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\"\n\"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.)\u00a0\n\"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.\n\"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking \u2013 instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\"\nWhat we get is a facsimile of reality \u2013 and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says.\nGhosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users \u2013 which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption \u2013 but it can muddy the waters around how they \u2013 and their outputs \u2013 are perceived.\nOne way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation.\nWhen we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses.\n\"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\"\nThat's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered.\nThis is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" \u2013 named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates \u2013 on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted.\nIt is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.\nBut what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker \u2013 in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had \u2013 or created \u2013 a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\"\nWhile this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm \u2013 a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.)\nAI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\"\nAnd that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Mohamed Salah has lost two Afcon finals with Egypt \nWho would have thought a discussion on the brilliance of Mohamed Salah would spark a heated social-media row about the merits of the Africa Cup of Nations?\nWell that's what happened when Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\".\nSo what did Carragher say? Who else has spoken out? And is Afcon disrespected by a European-centric view of world football?\nBBC Sport attempts to break down and explain the issues.\nSpeaking after Liverpool's 2-0 Premier League win at Manchester City on Sunday, pundits in the Sky Sports studio were discussing Salah's performance and whether this season could be one of the \"greatest\" individual campaigns.\nBBC Sport explored that discussion on Monday.\nThe debate then turned to whether Salah could be in line to win the Ballon d'Or - a prestigious annual award for the best player in the world.\nThe Ballon d'Or is voted for by 100 journalists from around the world, and was won last year by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.\nFormer Liverpool defender Carragher suggested Salah would have to win the Champions League in order to win the Ballon d'Or because Afcon is not recognised by voters as a \"major tournament\".\nHe added: \"I think the problem is the fact he's with Egypt, and he's probably not playing in the major tournament as such, or maybe got a great chance of winning, I think it's either the Champions League or the major tournament. Normally, the player who excels in that.\"\nCarragher's repeated use of the term \"major tournament\" irked fellow pundits Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge. \nRichards stressed Afcon was a \"major tournament\", saying: \"A lot of people are at home saying 'They aren't taking it seriously.' Afcon is a big tournament.\"\nFormer Liverpool striker Sturridge said: \"It's a fact. If you win the Euros or Copa America it's deemed to be big - so the Afcon is at the same level.\"\nCarragher responded: \"Egypt are not going to win the World Cup are they?\" And when Richards tried to explain, he cut him off and said \"Oh God.\"\nClips of the exchange were shared widely across social media.\nOn Monday, Carragher attempted to clarify his comments on X, saying Salah was \"at a disadvantage playing for Egypt in terms of him winning the Ballon d'Or\".\n\"If Salah had an average season at LFC but won the Afcon & was MVP [Most Valuable Player] I don't think he would win the Ballon d'Or. Because I don't think Afcon carries the weight of other tournaments.\n\"But if Mbappe had an average season at Real Madrid but won the World Cup/Euros, he would still have a great opportunity.\"\nIs Salah set for greatest individual Premier League season?\nClub versus country dilemma for Afcon players\nEverything you need to know about Afcon 2023\nCarragher's comments drew criticism from a number of former players. \nWriting on X, former Aston Villa and Egypt captain Ahmed Elmohamady said: \"Jamie Carragher doesn't know what major tournaments [are] because he never won one. Afcon is a major tournament. So proud to [have] won it twice.\"\nFormer Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on his podcast that while he understood Carragher's point about the weight of Afcon on Ballon d'Or voting, he thought the comment was \"an ignorant thought process\" and Afcon should be \"respected more than it is\".\nCarragher - replying on Ferdinand's Instagram account - called his former England team-mate a \"clown\" and suggested he was \"playing to the gallery\".\nAfcon is held every two years and has typically been staged during European winter time.\nNo African nation has ever won the World Cup, and only one - Morocco at Qatar 2022 - has reached the semi-finals.\nIn a comparison of the wealth of the federations, Ivory Coast won $7m (\u00a35.5m) for winning Afcon 2023, Argentina won $42m (\u00a333.3m) for winning the last World Cup, and Spain won approximately 28m euros (\u00a323.4m) for winning Euro 2024.\nFormer AC Milan and Liberia striker George Weah is the only African player to have won the Ballon d'Or - having done so in 1995. \nSenegal and former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane - in 2022 - is the only African player to have finished in the top three in the voting in the 21st century. \nThe highest Salah has finished is fifth - in 2019 and 2022.\nIn 2021, former Arsenal and England player Ian Wright said some media coverage of Afcon was \"tinged with racism\", asking \"Is there ever a tournament more disrespected than the Africa Cup of Nations?\"\nTo get an idea of the value of Afcon, all you have to do is listen to some of the continent's greatest ever players. Legends such as Samuel Eto'o, Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba - or the big stars still in action, like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez.\nThey have trophy cabinets full of medals and titles from European club football, but Afcon means everything to them.\nComparisons will always be made to the quality of the Euros and the Copa America, but - just like those tournaments - it's incredibly difficult to win the trophy for even the biggest names and biggest countries.\nI've lost count of the amount of times the tournament favourites have crumbled under the pressure, or in tough conditions against so-called smaller football nations.\nDrogba never won it despite playing in a golden generation of Ivory Coast talent. Salah is yet to lift the trophy, and I can still picture how devastated he was after losing the finals in 2017 and 2021.\nThe organisers also argue the interest in the tournament around the world is increasing all the time. And having been in Ivory Coast at the last edition, I feel that too.\nIt was one of the most exciting I've experienced with the dramatic storyline of the hosts sacking their manager in the group stage before making a remarkable comeback and winning the final. On the ground it certainly felt that it was bigger than ever before with more worldwide interest than ever before.\nYes, there have been many issues in the past that have damaged the reputation of the tournament. For example late changes to the location, such as when Egypt hosted in 2019 instead of Cameroon, who weren't ready. Or changes to the timing, for example with the next edition which was due to take place in June and July but will now start just before Christmas.\nThen there are difficulties with infrastructure, security or organisation. But similar issues have also impacted the Euros and the Copa America in recent years.\nI've always found complaints about the tournament taking place in the middle of the European season overblown. Yes it's frustrating for the clubs but why should African football be dictated to by the European game? Weather conditions also make hosting it in June and July impossible in certain areas of the continent.\nThe tournament may not get the respect it deserves in some parts of the world but after covering six Afcons I get the impression that's changing and that the next edition in Morocco, where football is booming right now, will be bigger than ever and may just have an impact on the Ballon d'Or voting.\nAfcon is being 'disrespected' - Wright\nClub World Cup dates 'disrespectful' to Africa\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The Traitors contestant Elen Wyn has said she was laughed at by a GP and told she had a low pain threshold during her 10-year wait for an endometriosis diagnosis. \nElen, from Anglesey, said she suffered with pain that felt like \"barbed wire around her stomach\" before her diagnosis, which she was told was \"just period pains\".\nShe added GPs needed to treat women's health with greater sensitivity and called for better funding from the Welsh government. \nThe Welsh government said it was spending \u00a33m on a women's health hub in each health board by March 2026. \nThe Traitors star, originally from Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy in Anglesey - who was eliminated on episode two - said she was diagnosed just before appearing on the reality show in 2024 - 10 years after her symptoms started.\nElen, now 24, said when her periods began at 14, she frequently missed school and sat out of sport, but a GP insisted she just had a low pain tolerance. \nShe said she was offered a contraceptive pill if she was really struggling, but she did not feel comfortable with this option while not sexually active.\nShe said she continued to suffer so badly she was unable to walk or leave the house. \n\"Sometimes it's like you're being repeatedly stabbed,\" she said. \n\"I knew it wasn't normal regardless of what I was told.\"\nShe began to piece together that her symptoms closely aligned with endometriosis after seeing other sufferers on TikTok and, while studying in Cardiff when she was about 21, tried again to push for answers from medical professionals.\n\"I saw another GP but he said the same, that my pain tolerance was too low. \n\"I remember him laughing at me, it was awful,\" she said.\nElen then requested to see a female GP, who she said \"completely validated\" her and agreed she could have endometriosis. \nBut when both an ultrasound and an MRI scan came back clear of the condition, Elen pushed for a laparoscopy, and it was only then that her stage four endometriosis was detected.\nThe disease had spread across Elen's bowel, bladder, fallopian tubes and kidney and, while she is currently on a four-year waiting list for surgery, she has been using her TikTok account to raise awareness about the condition. \nEndometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation where tissue similar to the lining of the womb is found in other areas of the body, including the fallopian tubes, pelvis, bowel, vagina and intestines.\nIn rare cases it has even been found in the lungs, eyes, spine and brain. It was once thought that the only place in the body where endometriosis did not occur was the spleen, but in 2020 it was found there also.\nSymptoms include severe to debilitating pain often in the pelvic area, fatigue, and heavy periods, and the condition is also associated with infertility.\nResearch by charity Endometriosis UK found the average diagnosis time for endometriosis in Wales was nine years and 11 months in 2024. \nThis was the longest diagnosis time across the UK and had increased from nine years in 2020.\nElen said she was given no support from her GP while she awaited her diagnosis, adding: \"I have been offered the coil or the pill, [but] other than that I was given nothing which is so frustrating.\"\nShe said through her own research she had made changes to her lifestyle to manage her condition, including cutting down her alcohol and caffeine intake as well as engaging in low-impact exercise and prioritising sleep. \n\"I don't suffer nearly as much as I used to... [but] I have done that all on my own,\" she said. \nShe added: \"I think a narrative needs to be erased here. Because it's a condition associated with female hormones, people tend to link the symptoms with being dramatic and it's really frustrating to me.\n\"There is so much stigma around it and I think that stigma needs to be deleted.\" \nElen has called on the Welsh government to offer more funding, better information and greater sensitivity to women's health. \n\"I think GPs need to spend more time exploring symptoms and offering other solutions rather than just the pill or the coil, it's ridiculous,\" she said. \nThe Welsh government said endometriosis was one of the eight priorities outlined  in its Women's Health Plan for Wales.\n\"We have already funded endometriosis nurses in every health board, developed the Endometriosis Cymru website and provided \u00a350 million of additional funding to help cut the longest waiting times, which includes gynaecological conditions,\" it said.\nIt added \u00a33m would be used to establish a Women's Health Hub in every health board by March 2026, \"to support timely diagnosis and management of menstrual conditions including endometriosis\".",

I'm just hoping they'll let me in when I show up.\"\nThe Bolton actor's turn as PC Mukherjee was a high point in the hilarious outing, as the intrepid new PC was central to the plot, helping the iconic title characters track down their penguin nemesis, the master of disguise Feathers McGraw.\nThe film also featured the vocal talents of Patel's fellow Boltonian, comedian Peter Kay, who voiced PC Mukherjee's superior, Ch Insp Mackintosh.\nCreator and Preston-born Nick Park and his Bristol-based Aardman Animations team have already won four Oscars, so Patel said hopes were high that they would add to that achievement.\n\"The team are so insanely talented and their minds are brilliant and the script is so witty and so fun,\" she said. \n\"It made it such an enjoyable job to work on [and they are] also just all lovely people.\n\"They've got Oscars and they're very successful, they're very well known. \n\"But they're all just really lovely, down to earth people who just want to make the film as good as it can be.\"\nThe trip to the Oscars comes three years after Patel landed her first role in coming-of-age musical drama Everybody's Talking About Jamie. \nThat success came just days after she was rejected by a number of drama schools and she said she got the part in an open online audition.\nSince then, she said she \"fell head first\" into the industry, which was \"kind of mental\", and she recently joined the cast of BBC drama Waterloo Road for the latest series.\nShe said becoming a professional actor was a dream come true.\n\"I never thought that I would be able to do it professionally in this capacity,\" she said.\n\"I was like, 'oh, maybe I'll go to drama school and then in like 10 years, I'll get a little bit on the telly and, and that'll be great'. \n\"And I'll maybe do some community theatre because that's really fun. \n\"But yeah, it's mad. I can't believe it.\n\"Everyone who has ever met me as a child would know that I loved singing and dancing and attention.\"\nShe said she was excited about every aspect of her trip and had chosen her all-important red carpet outfit.\n\"I wanted to find something that I felt really good in, that I felt represented who I was and I think I found that,\" she said.\nHowever, she added that she would keep the exact details of the outfit \"under wraps\".\nAbove everything else though, she said there was one thing she was really looking forward to.\n\"I'm really excited to see Raye perform,\" she said.\n\"I love her so much and I've never seen her live and the first time I'm going to see her is at the Oscars, which is mental.\"\nThe 97th Academy Awards will be held in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on Sunday. Coverage will be on the BBC News website.\nYou can watch Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl on BBC iPlayer.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

        "article_text": "Four weeks after giving birth to her second child, Congresswoman Brittany Pettersen cradled her baby son in her arms as she cast a crucial vote on the House floor.\nUnable to vote remotely due to congressional rules, the Colorado Democrat flew across the country to oppose a multi-trillion-dollar budget deal, which narrowly passed in the House of Representatives.\n\"Unfortunately, I wasn't given the opportunity to vote remotely after giving birth, but I wasn't going to let that stop me from representing my constituents,\" Pettersen said on Tuesday.\nThe congresswoman - the 14th lawmaker to give birth while in office - now leads a bipartisan push for more flexibility for members with growing families.  \nIn January, she introduced legislation allowing proxy voting for up to 12 weeks for members  who have \"given birth or whose spouse have given birth and pregnant members who are unable to travel safely or have a serious medical condition\". The bill has 137 bipartisan co-sponsors.\nProxy voting - where a lawmaker designates another to vote on their behalf - was temporarily allowed during the pandemic, but current House rules prohibit it. \nThe restriction allowed some to see the unintended benefits of proxy voting for those recovering from childbirth or illness, but critics argued the policy was being abused.  \nMore than 100 Republican members of the House of Representatives, including current Speaker Mike Johnson, filed lawsuit to end the practice, arguing it was unconstitutional.\nThe legal argument failed, but when Republicans regained control of the House in 2023, former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy ended proxy voting. \nPettersen and another Republican congresswoman who gave birth in 2023 continue to push for flexibility for new parents on Capitol Hill. \nCongresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican who gave birth in 2023, missed 137 votes in the weeks after she gave birth. Doctors had advised her not to travel while recovering from a difficult birth.\nLuna called the inability to proxy vote a \"slap in the face to every constituent\" who elected her. \n\"How is it not discriminatory to tell a duly elected member of Congress that she can't vote because she gave birth to a child?\" she said in a video statement  last month. \"New mothers in Congress should not be forced to choose their careers over children or choose children over careers.\"\nBut Republican leadership has yet to budge.\n\"I have great sympathy, empathy for all of our young women legislators who are of birthing age. It's a real quandary,\" Johnson said in a statement last month. \"But I'm afraid it doesn't fit with the language of the Constitution, and that's the inescapable truth that we have.\"\nJean Sinzdak, associate director at the Center for American Women and Politics, said the pushback, in part, is cultural: many of the leaders of institutions like congress are older men who are not concerned about the trials of young parents and families.\n\"It doesn't behove the leaders of these institutions to change this process because it's not affecting them directly,\"  Ms Sinzdak told the BBC.\nThe UK parliament now  allows proxy voting for members of parliament who are new parents, experiencing childbirth complications or need fertility treatment. The European parliament currently has no provisions to allow heavily pregnant members to vote if they can't physically make it to Strasbourg, the formal seat of the office.\nPettersen and Luna are now trying to bypass Johnson and put the legislation  to a floor vote - it is a tough road but it may be their best shot unless the thinking surrounding proxy voting changes.

I couldn't understand what did you say to me. You told me you gave them food, water and they told you that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy, they don't want anything else?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes because I asked them by megaphone \"Greece or Italia?\" and everybody there screaming Italia.\nOfficer 2: Aah, OK, OK everybody screaming that they don't want Greece and they want Italy?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes, yes, yes.\nOfficer 2: OK\nLucky Sailor captain: They are all like crowded people, very crowded, full deck.\nOfficer 2: OK, captain.

They want nothing from Greece and they want to go to Italy.\nLucky Sailor captain: OK, yes, yes.\nAnother vessel, the Faithful Warrior, also gave some supplies to the migrant boat but no further conversations between its captain and the Greek authorities have emerged.\nThe Greek coastguard did not comment on the contents of the conversations but told the BBC it had submitted \"all the material it had in its possession, including the audio recordings and the diaries of events\" to the Maritime Court Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating.\nIt said it had rescued more than a quarter of a million migrants in danger at sea in the last decade and arrested more than a thousand smugglers, and that its humanitarian work had been recognised internationally.\nOur BBC investigation in the immediate days after the sinking challenged the Greek authorities' explanation for the disaster.\nAnalysis of the movement of other ships in the area suggests the overcrowded fishing vessel was not moving for at least seven hours before it capsized.\nThe coastguard has always insisted that during these hours the boat was on a course to Italy and not in need of rescue.\nLast year, a Greek court threw out charges against nine Egyptian men who were accused of causing the shipwreck. \nThe judges in the southern port city of Kalamata ruled they did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, on the grounds the vessel sank in international waters.\nThe indictment had showed that the defendants were being prosecuted on evidence that had already been contradicted by at least six survivors, who told the BBC the coastguard had caused their boat to capsize and then pressured them to frame the Egyptians.\nHuman rights lawyer, Dimitris Choulis, who represented some of the accused Egyptians said he was not surprised by what these recordings.\n\"We know about the coastguard's tactics of either pushing back or not rescuing people.\"\nHe claimed there had been \"an attempted cover up from day one.\"\n\"They [Greek authorities] told the story 'they did not want to be rescued' and so have insulted the memory of so many dead people,\" he told the BBC.\nHuman rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said they have strong reservations about the integrity of the Greek investigation and have called for an international investigation.\nThe Greek Ombudsman - an independent authority removed from the government - has been looking at the allegations.\nThe disaster is also being examined by the Greek Naval Court.",

        "article_text": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of J\u00f8rn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023.\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it \u2013 the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\u00a0\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018.\nThe judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\u00a0\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A\u00a33.5m or A$7m \u2013 at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 \u2013 the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\u00a0\nBut this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A\u00a312.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\nThe project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors \u2013 the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\u00a0\nUtzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\u00a0\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (\u00a351m).\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The first ever video game console\n\u2022\u00a0How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe\n\u2022\u00a0How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (\u00a333m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him.\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAs a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Bj\u00f6rk\u00a0and Massive Attack. In 1980,\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger\u00a0won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a book about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country.\nA Journey In Service, which chronicles his life, especially while he was in office from 1985 to 1993, has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently.\nHere are four takeaways from the book:\nThis is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still hasn't really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.\nIn the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.\nThe poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil. \nThe date of the vote \u2013 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.\nGen Babangida was forced to resign.\nMoshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.\nNigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.\n\"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes.\nGen Babangida, popularly known as IBB, acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, won the election.\nHowever, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis. \nAt the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country\u2019s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.\nAbiola\u2019s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.\n\u201dPerhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,\u201d he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.\nCivilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Sani Abacha.\nGeneral Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.\n\"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls.\n\"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\"\nHowever, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers. \n\"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\"\nVatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.\n\"I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,\" he writes.\nAnother contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.\nThe fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects.\nHe highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.\nThe book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.\nThe former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.\nBabangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.\n\"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.\nThe association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war. \nMany Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential First Lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried.\n\"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled \u2013 and she often smiled \u2013 her face lit up, and her eyes danced,\" he writes.\n\"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.\"\n\"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,\" Babangida says.\nHe describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Their title hopes appear as good as over but can Arsenal return to winning ways when they play fellow high-fliers Nottingham Forest on Wednesday?\n\"Arsenal have stuffed up their title bid haven't they?\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"There are many reasons for that, but one of them is their indiscipline - it has really cost them this season.\n\"They need to win every game from here to match their points tally from last season but will that happen with Mikel Merino playing as a makeshift centre-forward? I don't see it, and they seem to be making it up as they go along.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor the midweek fixtures in week 27, he takes on singer Paige Cavell, who is a Chelsea fan.\nCavell has had over 1.6m likes on TikTok and her new single, Owe It All To You featuring DJ icon Goddard, is out now.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nSince 2023, Cavell has sung on John Summit's Tears, Kaskade & Wilkinson's Shine On, and ACRAZE's The Otherside. \nCavell's family are Chelsea fans and she has followed in their footsteps by becoming a season ticket holder at Stamford Bridge.\n\"My mum's side of the family are Battersea born and bred and my dad's side were from Fulham, so Chelsea is all I've ever known!\" she told BBC Sport. \n\"I have quite literally been a fan since I was a baby. There is a picture of me, a few months old, at Stamford Bridge [see Paige's TikTok story here, or below], external on the pitch and touching the goal post.\n\"One of the best days of my life was a few years back, when my picture was put up at the stadium. Having been a fan ever since I can remember, it was crazy really.\n\"We had gone to the 2017 FA Cup final at Wembley and had good seats near the front - there were a load of photographers there taking pictures of the fans so, for a joke, I told my mum I was going to get in the programme. I started singing really loudly and held my scarf up for the cameras.\n\"A few months later, at the start of the following season, I got a phone call from one of my mates telling me there was a picture of me up at the stadium. \n\"I wasn't actually at that game, which was a bit annoying, so I was like 'are you joking me!?!'. \n\"Honestly, to this day, it was possibly one of the best days of my life when I got to see it for myself, although my brother was fuming because he is a huge Chelsea fan too and he was going 'why wasn't that me!?'\n\"I must say, as I've got older, being a Chelsea fan has become a little bit harder. When I was younger, we used to go to all the parades but obviously we've not won much recently.\n\"I think that my love for them has actually grown during all these rubbish times though. When, you're in the crowd with people going 'oh for god's sake' when things go wrong or after the game with everyone walking back to Fulham Broadway Station in silence, you realise how you stay together whatever happens.\n\"Every team goes through ups and downs and as much as we all want to be on top all the time, that just doesn't happen in football.\"\nChris Sutton and Paige Cavell were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nAllow TikTok content?\nThis article contains content provided by TikTok.

They need to find their feet again quickly, because I don't think anyone saw that result coming.\nI am pretty sure the readers will go for a 1-1 draw here and, although I'd like to pick a winner, I also think it will end up honours even.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nPaige's prediction: This is going to be close but I am backing Bournemouth - maybe I am still a bit sour about Brighton beating us twice in the space of a week. 2-3\nSelhurst Park, 19:30 GMT\nIt looks like fifth place will get you into the Champions League next season and that is the most interesting race at the top now the title is pretty much done and dusted.\nHalf of the Premier League will feel they have a chance of making it and Aston Villa are definitely one of those sides in the hunt.\nI am not sure Villa will pick up three points here, though.\nCrystal Palace don't score many goals at home - just 12 in 13 league games this season - and they don't win that many there either, just two so far in fact.\nBut at the same time, Villa are not great on the road - they have only won once away in the Premier League since the middle of October.\nI don't like to mention it but I was exactly right about Villa beating Chelsea 2-1 at the weekend, and I feel like they are a much easier team to predict than Palace are.\nPeople are getting excited about what Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio will do in Unai Emery's side but I think this is a tough game for Villa, especially with the form Jean-Philippe Mateta is in for Palace.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nPaige's prediction: My manager is a Palace fan and he says they are a bit inconsistent at the moment. He did mention that he thinks Mateta will score for them but, after Villa drew with Liverpool the other day, I think this is going to be another draw. 1-1\nMolineux, 19:30 GMT\nMatheus Cunha is on fire for Wolves, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions, and his side are now five points clear of the relegation zone with a better goal difference than the teams below them.\nThey wiped the floor with Fulham at Craven Cottage earlier in the season too, and Cunha scored twice in a 4-1 victory.\nIt all points towards a Wolves win here too, but I cannot seem to get a Fulham prediction right at the moment so I need to have a proper think about this one.\nBecause I have been wrong, so often, about Fulham, I am going for the opposite of what I think will happen and back them to win. \nMarco Silva's side do actually seem to be better on the road than at home right now, and they beat Newcastle in their last away league game. They didn't click at the weekend against Crystal Palace but they usually have a goal or two in them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nPaige's prediction: Fulham are going to take this. I was going to back them anyway but I have spoken to a friend of mine who supports them and he said they had been playing well - he also said that Adama Traore will score against his former club. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 20:15 GMT\nChelsea have looked very flat in recent weeks and ended up being beaten by Aston Villa on Saturday after taking the lead.\nEnzo Maresca's side are desperate to get back to winning ways so this is the perfect game for them - you could not ask for more of an open goal at the moment than playing Southampton at home.\nSaints will give Chelsea the chance to find their rhythm again and I don't see them keeping them out.\nI must say every week how dismal this season has been for Southampton fans, and probably the only thing they have to look forward to at the moment is the prospect of a day out in Norwich next season when they are back in the Championship. \nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nPaige's prediction: I have been bold here, I had to be! We have been struggling a bit recently but, because Southampton are bottom of the table, I am backing us to get a few goals and get a good result. Cole Palmer is going to get one or two goals in this one, I am backing him, and I will be at this game so I will be shouting loudly for him, especially if it is 2-0 and we need another goal for my prediction. 3-0\nPaige's favourite Chelsea player: On the back of my shirt it was always 'Lampard' and he was my hero. I was Chelsea's mascot once, at an away game against Manchester City and he was injured that day - my little heart was broken. Frank and Didier Drogba were my favourite players then and now it is Palmer. It has to be, really - he's been one of the few players we can rely on.\nPaige on Chelsea's season: We've been struggling recently but what's been really difficult as a fan is seeing little sparks of brilliance that make you think 'there it is! That's what we can do'. But they just don't last and what I've noticed, especially recently, is that unless we get a kick up the backside, nothing happens. We can be really lacklustre when I want to see us really trying from the moment we walk out on the pitch.\nEven so, we are still seventh, and only one point off fourth place.  We are kind of there, in the background but the top four is definitely doable if we could just find some consistency.\nGtech Community Stadium, 19:30 GMT\nThis is going to be close. Brentford have had back-to-back wins over West Ham and Leicester, while Everton's improvement under David Moyes has been dramatic.\nMoyes has done an incredible job but Everton have not suddenly become world-beaters. I do think they will lose some games, and this is one of them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nPaige's prediction: I don't know anyone who supports either of these teams and they have both been doing well so I couldn't make my mind up. I got an Amazon delivery while I was deciding on my scores so I told the driver I was doing this for the BBC and asked him to give me a score. He went with Everton to win 2-0, so if it goes wrong, I am blaming him. 0-2\nOld Trafford, 19:30 GMT\nManchester United drew at Ipswich in November, in Ruben Amorim's first game in charge.\nThree months on, Ipswich will head to Old Trafford thinking they have a decent chance of beating them. No-one fears United at the moment.\nYou just don't know which United side is going to turn up and, in the first half against Everton on Saturday, they were absolutely woeful.\nUnited do deserve some credit for the way they fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Goodison Park but I am not convinced by them at all.\nIpswich ended up losing 4-1 to Tottenham at the weekend but they created a ridiculous amount of chances in that game, and they will get opportunities here too because Liam Delap is such a handful.\nA win for the Tractor Boys would be huge, especially now the gap to fourth-bottom Wolves has grown to five points, but despite United's many problems I just have a feeling Amorim will get a win, somehow.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nPaige's prediction: I have gone with United here. I know they are having a pretty bad season but being at home should give them the edge. 2-1\nCity Ground, 19:30 GMT\nSaturday's home defeat by West Ham was a real hammer blow for Arsenal's title hopes.\nThey need to bounce back and find a way of beating Nottingham Forest but this is a tough trip after such a devastating result, and I am not so sure they will take the points here either.\nForest are not in great form themselves, and got a bit of a walloping by Newcastle. Nuno Espirito Santo was clearly unhappy with some of his side's defending in that game.\nBut how are Arsenal going to score goals? I don't know at the moment.\nIf Gunners boss Mikel Arteta needs a left-back, he has got a few of them on the bench. Unfortunately he needs a centre-forward, and there is not one of those to be seen.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nPaige's prediction: This is going to be a very interesting game. I face-timed my best mate because her and her dad are Gunners , they are Arsenal mad. He reads this column every week and he loves it. He said this is going to be close - I said 2-2 and he said he agreed, but if one player can make a difference for Arsenal, it is Ethan Nwaneri. He has been brilliant recently but I am not sure he will win this for them. 2-2\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 19:30 GMT\nHow on earth am I supposed to predict what will happen here?\nIt's a fascinating game but it's impossible to call because it could end up 3-0 to either team.\nManchester City were subdued against Liverpool and while Jeremy Doku looked bright on their left flank, they didn't offer much of a threat elsewhere.\nTottenham put four goals past Ipswich but they could have conceded a few themselves, and you have to think City will have opportunities here.\nSpurs thumped Pep Guardiola's side 4-0 in November, but I am going for City to take the points this time. It will be close but they might just nick it.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nPaige's prediction: City are not having a great time of it but there is still quality in their team. You never know what Tottenham are going to do, so I gave them a goal, but City will still win. 1-2\nAnfield, 20:15 GMT\nThis fixture has plenty of history behind it - Liverpool's 4-3 win at Anfield in 1996 will always be remembered as a Premier League classic.\nNewcastle come into it in good shape after a good win over Nottingham Forest, but the way Liverpool beat Manchester City was extremely impressive.\nIt was such a mature performance by Arne Slot's side to soak up City's possession and be so clinical in front of goal.\nI think we know by now that Slot's side will be hard to beat, while Newcastle are still quite up and down - they were very poor when they went to Etihad Stadium last week.\nThey are capable of giving Liverpool a good game but I am going to say that the leaders will take the points, and carry on their title charge.\nAlong with Forest striker Chris 'The Wood Chopper' Wood, Newcastle's Alexander Isak has been one of the best players in the Premier League this season, but there is only one candidate to be crowned Player of the Year.\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah's numbers are extraordinary and he looks as hungry as ever. He has been relentless, and he is not done yet.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nPaige's prediction: A good friend of mine from university is a Newcastle fan, and she sent me a very annoyed voice-note last week after the Manchester City game, about how bad they were. They were much better against Forest on Sunday but no-one is stopping Liverpool now. 3-1\nLondon Stadium, 19:30 GMT\nWest Ham defended really well against Arsenal on Saturday and countered really well. \nTheir manager Graham Potter will be looking for his side to build on that victory and with Jarrod Bowen up front they will have too much firepower for the Foxes.\nThis is a gimme for West Ham, and it should be a routine victory for them.\nI just cannot make a case for Leicester to get anything here and it looks like their hopes of staying up have had it too.\nLike Southampton fans, the only thing Leicester supporters have to look forward to is the chance to visit Norwich next season. It's a nice city, and I fully recommend it for a day out.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nPaige's prediction: I know West Ham beat Arsenal on Saturday but I've not been convinced by either of these teams in the past few weeks. 1-1\nChris got six correct results from the 10 Premier League games in week 26, with one exact score, giving him a total of 90 points.\nThat was enough to beat his guest, singer Bradley Simpson, who got four correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 40 points, but Chris had to settle for a tie with the BBC readers. \nUsing the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, they also got six correct results with one exact score, meaning they also ended up with 90 points.",

This is a fundamental American freedom\".\nSoon after taking office in January, the Trump administration signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", a move the White House said reflects the gulf's status as \"an indelible part of America\".\n\nThe AP said it would continue to use the term Gulf of Mexico, while acknowledging the Trump administration's efforts to rename it. \nIn response, the administration began clamping down on the AP's access to White House events covered by the \"pool\" of journalists that cover smaller events and report back to other media outlets. \nOn Monday, Judge McFadden said he declined the request from the AP for emergency relief because he did not believe the publication was suffering \"irreparable harm\" from the ban, according to CNN. The judge said the AP could access the same information from notes that other White House pool members had gathered.\nStill, during several points in the hearing, he called the ban \"discriminatory\" and problematic\", CNN reported.\nAP reporters still have access to the White House grounds. \nThe AP lawsuit specifically names three administration figures - Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich  -as it seeks to regain access. \n\"The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,\" the AP said in the lawsuit. \nOn a trip with the White House pool to Florida last week, the BBC witnessed an AP reporter and one of its photographers be told by an official that they were a \"no go\" for the trip after clearing security at Joint Base Andrews a short while before Air Force One was due to depart. \nOver the course of the next several days, the AP team - which had travelled to Florida unilaterally - was repeatedly prevented from joining the pool of reporters covering Trump at his estate in Mar-a-Lago, as well as a trip to the Daytona 500 Nascar race. \nSpeaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago on 18 February, Trump said that \"we're going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America\". \n\"We're very proud of this country,\" he said. \"We want it to be the Gulf of America\". \nLast week, dozens of news organisations - including conservative outlets such as Fox and NewsMax - signed a letter organised by the White House Correspondents' Association in which they urged the White House to reconsider its stance on the AP.

        "article_text": "Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed.\nIsrael said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including \"humiliating\" handover ceremonies.\nA senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to \"grave danger\" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel.\nThe deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that the ceasefire was \"precarious\" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. \nHe also called for the \"dignified release of all remaining hostages\".\nOn Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages.\nAs with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel.\nLater, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a \"sickening display of cruelty\".\nThere was already fury in Israel after Hamas  returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.\nIt emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day.\nIsraeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys \"with their bare hands\", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike.\nIsrael was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails.\nThey had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers.\nIn the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed \"in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes\".\n\"It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies.\"\nHamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a \"blatant violation\" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released.\n\"We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,\" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday.\nAsked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that \"all options are on the table\".\n\"Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],\" he added.\n\"Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?\"\nNaim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released.\nThe White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an \"appropriate response\" to what it called the \"barbaric treatment\" of hostages by Hamas.\nBut President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting \"an extension of phase one\".\n\"We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,\" he told CNN on Sunday.\nA total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase.\nSo far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal.\nThe agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day.\nThe ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nAt least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nMost of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",

        "article_text": "Kyiv and Washington are close to signing a deal over US access to Ukraine's mineral deposits, a Ukrainian minister says.\nOlga Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said on X that \"negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalised\". \nShe added that \"we are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature\".\nUkraine has been facing growing pressure from the US administration to sign the deal, which has ended up in the centre of the growing rift between the US and Ukrainian presidents.\nZelensky first included the offer of an agreement on minerals in the so-called \"victory plan\" that he presented to Trump last September.\nThe idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.\nGraphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nOn Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\". \nPrior to Stefanishyna's assertion that a deal was close, there appeared to be several sticking points.\nLast Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a reported 50% share of its rare earth minerals - which Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.\n\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.\nThe provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.\nInstead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.\nTrump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.\nHowever, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.\nZelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".\nHe rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\" but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to offering the US access to Russia's rare minerals, in order to counter a potential deal between the US and Ukraine.\nIn a televised interview on Russian state-owned broadcaster Rossiya 1, he said it would include access to Russia's \"new territories\" - those it has seized and occupied in Ukraine since their invasion three years ago.\n\"We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine,\" Putin said, adding Russia was ready to \"attract foreign partners\".",

        "article_text": "Ariana Grande, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\". \nAhead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), the nominees from all categories were invited to mingle over dinner and cocktails, as an eventful awards race reaches its conclusion.\nThe class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires. \nHere are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:\nCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked. \nThe two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.\nBefore the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"\nLast week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long. \nWicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nWe're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority. \nThe woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short. \nThe film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.\nJoining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.\nSalda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes. \nAs a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year. \nMadison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.\nJames Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.\nSo why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish? \nIt's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees. \nDespite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.\nIn a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.\nThey are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.\nThe movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan. \nSitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.\nIn the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. \nShe is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown. \nAlso hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile. \nThe pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary. \nSir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair. \nIt's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.\nInstead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown. \nIn his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.\nHowever, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest. \nSeated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.\nAdding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan. \nBrody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman. \nSing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.\nThe Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.\nThe actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.\nFiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.\nUnderstandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.\nBut others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.\nThe actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories. \nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nSing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.\nBut he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.\nMaclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme. \nIn the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze. \nLook back on previous class photos:\n2024: 10 things we spotted from Margot Robbie to Billie Eilish\n2023: Brendan Fraser has a 'whale of a time\n2020: From Quentin Tarantino to a Frozen couple\n2019: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper among stars\n2018: Cardboard cutouts and splashes of colour\n2017: Pharrell Williams dresses down\nNote: there were no class photos taken during Covid",

        "article_text": "The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned.\nAid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut.\nIt is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected.\nThe conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023.\nThe kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods.\n\"People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\"\nThe Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID.\nThe State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice.\nThe normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance \u2013 on which the communal kitchens depend \u2013 will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes.\nThe closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations.\nThe network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID.\nIt's a \"huge setback\" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who's set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms.\nThe former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN.\nMoney had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works.\n\"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets (humanitarian group) in Syria.\"\nFor Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out.\nThere was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege.\nMost of the kitchens have closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon \"we expect to see a lot of people starving\".\nHere and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID.\n\"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],\" she said, \"but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was.\"\n\"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,\" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation.\nThey are \"exhausted, traumatised and underfunded\" and \"we were scaling up to help them\".\nThe State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful.\n\"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\" it said in response to a BBC query.\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances.\nIn 2024 the United States was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan.\nTop UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries.\n\"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,\" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month.\nThe influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further.\n\"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,\" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director.\nHe had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. \"We are strained. It's extremely difficult.\"\nThey both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, \"it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger\", says Ms Dagesh.\nMost families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority.\n\"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,\" she said.\nMost of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people.\nThey say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing.\nFaced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape.\nMany of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods.\nThey would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight.\nWith the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders.\nYet aid agencies that normally would help are strained. \nThe UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise \"to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum\".\nIt does not help that the agency was already underfunded. \nThe UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut \"everything\", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive.\nThe US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo. \n\"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,\" Mr Balde told the BBC.\nFaced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on \"very dangerous journeys\", says Mr Balde.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Tom Rowland played five games for England U18s, alongside the likes of Marcus Smith, Tom Willis, Joe Heyes and Ted Hill\nTom Rowland remembers rooming with Joe Heyes.\nLeicester prop Heyes is now part of England's Six Nations squad, coming off the bench in each of their three games so far.\nBack then though, in Cape Town, in 2017, both Heyes and Rowland were England Under-18s.\nBoth were props. Both were highly rated. Both would start against South Africa Schools the next day.\nBut, in other ways they were different.\n\"Joe was the size he is now, he was just an absolute beast,\" remembers Rowland.\n\"He was something like 130kg (20st 7lb) aged 16.\n\"Someone like him was made to play in the front row.\"\nRowland wasn't though.\nTwo years earlier, he had been a blind-side flanker or number eight, carrying hard for Bristol's academy team.\nHowever, his coach, seeing the trend for more mobile props, suggested he swap the back row for the front row.\n\"I was only 90kg (14st 2lb) at the time,\" Rowland says.\n\"I enjoyed my gym work, but I never dreamed of being fast-tracked into being a prop.\"\nThe change of position demanded a change in physique.\nRowland was given two aims - to load up the weights bar and his plate.\nSix meals a day, five weights sessions a week.\nEnergy in, power out and, hopefully, bulk up.\n\"I found it pretty tough,\" says Rowland. \"It was a conscious effort making sure I got the food in.\n\"My strength and conditioning coach would always be on to me. You'd have to weigh in in the mornings, you would step on the scales and find you had lost a kilo because you haven't had enough dinner the night before.\n\"I always like to eat relatively 'clean', but it got to a point where they said 'you just need the calories, we don't mind if you are smashing a load of dessert'.\n\"It was always a bit of a battle for me.\"\nRowland made his Bristol debut in February 2017 as an 18-year-old schoolboy\nIt was a battle he won. In the short term at least.\nA couple of years after changing position, he had put on three stone and the England Under-18 loose-head prop shirt.\nRowland played five games, lining up alongside Marcus Smith, Tom Willis, Cadan Murley and Ted Hill, all of whom, like Heyes, are playing for England in this year's Six Nations.\nRowland is still playing, just at a lower level, in a different country and, intriguingly, at a lighter weight.\nThis April, he will be part of the first-ever 'Small Blacks' team \u2013 a New Zealand representative side with a catch., external\nAll its members play weight-restricted rugby, in which no player, whether front row or fly-half, weighs more than 85kg (13st 5lbs).\nIn New Zealand, the concept has taken root.\nIn 2024, 45 teams entered the national under-85kg Cup, with the final taking place at Sky Stadium in Wellington as a curtain-raiser to an All Blacks win over Australia.\nThe players are smaller and more uniform in stature, but the action is fast and hard.\n\"If no-one had a number on their back, you would struggle to know who is playing which position,\" says Rowland.\n\"I wouldn't say it's like sevens, the games can still be quite physical and forward dominated, but everything's done at just a much greater pace.\n\"Everybody is pretty fit so the collisions in the 70th minute are just as hard as those in the opening five minutes of a game. There's no real drop off.\n\"The skill level from one to 15 is great. Even as a prop, you are expected to have as good a catch and pass as anyone in the backline.\n\"The only thing where there's probably a big step down is the set-piece, especially the line-outs. You have a lot of guys who aren't used to jumping in a line-out.\n\"But in a way less focus around the set-piece makes it a bit more exciting, it speeds everything up.\"\nRowland is certainly quicker than he was. Back in his England age-grade days, he weighed in about 17st 5lb.\nNow 26, he plays four stone lighter, the weight he was as a 14-year-old.\n\"I can still enjoy the scrummaging side but I am also now fit enough and at a good weight to be mobile and contribute around the pitch.\n\"I get to carry lots, make tackles and I actually play 80 minutes in most games. I really enjoy not having to get dragged off at around 50 or 60 minutes because I can't breathe any more.\"\nEden Lizards, the side Rowland plays for, won New Zealand's inaugural National Under-85kg Cup in 2020\nRowland's initial weight loss came during the Covid lockdown. Unable to dislodge the likes of Yann Thomas and Jake Woolmore in the first team, he had been released by Bristol.\nWithout access to weights, but with a desire to keep fit, he started running every day.\nWhen restrictions eased and he met up with friends again, Rowland's body shape had changed so dramatically, they thought he was ill.\nRowland felt the opposite.\n\"The weight just flew off me and I felt so much better,\" he says. \"I had more energy - I did have to sell my whole wardrobe though and buy new clothes!\"\nIn 2021, he moved to a new country as well, taking advantage of the New Zealand passport he has through his mother.\nIn a different hemisphere, things turned upside-down.\nWhere once he was piling on pounds any which way he could, now he has to be mindful of passing a weigh-in a couple of hours before matches.\nSome players will, like boxers, shed weight in saunas the night before, tip the scales and then wolf down carbohydrate-heavy food in the dressing room. \nCramps can creep up on those who misjudge their pre-match routine.\nWhen the New Zealand under-85kg team play their first match, it won't be an issue though. At least not for Rowland and his Small Blacks team-mates.\nTheir two matches against the full Sri Lanka national team (ranked 40th in the world) in Kandy and Colombo are being played at a catchweight.\nA cap of 105kg (16st 7lb) has been applied to ensure there isn't a dangerous discrepancy between the hosts and tourists.\n\"It will be interesting to see if we'll be able to kind of hold our own, obviously being a bit lighter than that,\" says Rowland.\nWeight-restricted rugby's potential for growth may be mostly at the grassroots level, retaining players who feel that, while rugby is a game for all sizes, they would prefer a format with more evenly matched physiques.\n\"There would be definitely a pocket of players who would really kind of enjoy this grade of rugby.

        "article_text": "Great Britain toured Australia in 1996\nEngland v Australia: Women's Test\nVenue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March)\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nLisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England's women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas.\n\"Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,\" says the former Great Britain captain. \"But I'm not going to lie - I'm a bit envious.\n\"I'd have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I'm made up for them.\"\nWhen England's players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank.\nTwenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series.\nSo they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos.\n\"I think what England need to do is not fear them,\" McIntosh says. \"Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry.\n\"But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there's no reason why you can't beat them.\"\nBack in 1996, Great Britain's travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia.\nA series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying \u00a329,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home.\nThen came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished.\nBut first came the fight just to get on to the pitch.\nPaula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach\n\"It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,\" says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain's assistant coach in 1996.\nSheldon was secretary of the Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women's game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia.\nAccepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn't a Great Britain women's team.\nSo with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid.\n\"These people who got involved were professional people,\" Sheldon says. \"And they were all giving their time for free.\n\"I would go: 'This is what I want, and I haven't got any money. Will you come on board?' And they'd say: 'Yeah.' Because they believed in what we were trying to do.\"\nIan Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find \u00a370,000 to pay for the tour.\nSheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. \"We were not funded by anywhere,\" she says, \"so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like \u00a334,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about \u00a31,000 to raise.\"\nAs the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together.\nThen with just weeks to go, the team's tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed.\nSheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager.\n\"I was asked: 'Do you think you could help them out?'\" Carter says.\n\"I was like: 'What do you mean?' They said: 'Go to Australia with them.' I was like: 'Hmm, I'd love to. Best go and ask my boss, really.'\n\"But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren't actually organised.\"\nThe touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit.\nSheldon says: \"The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn't secure them and didn't tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights.\n\"My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks' notice.\"\nAs Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. \"Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,\" she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem.\n\"There was no bank account set up in Australia,\" Carter says, \"and it wasn't like now, where you could ring the bank and say: 'I'm going to put this money in there and I'm going to spend it from my bank account.'\n\"One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: 'It's not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long.'\n\"So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with \u00a329,000 in cash and travellers' cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went.\"\nThe Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly.\n\"I think there was a lot of bartering,\" captain McIntosh says, \"trying to get good deals, where we'd get breakfast and tea included.\"\nThe team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held.\nGreat Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy.\n\"We got a penalty in the last few minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn't go over.\"\nNext was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened.\n\"We'd gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,\" Carter says.\n\"So we went to the airport and I said: 'Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?' And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that.' Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage.\n\"And then I said to him: 'OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers' cheques?' And this guy's face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers' cheques.\"\nIn Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. \"They were like student dorms,\" McIntosh says.\nHere, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit.\n\"We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,\" McIntosh says. \"But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt.\n\"We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions.\"\nBritain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider.\nBut for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough.\n\"I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn't be there,\" Carter says. \"My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: 'I'm missing you, Mummy.' And it would then take days to recover from that phone call.\n\"There was that pang of guilt because I'm out here and I'm having a great time. At the same time, I've left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing?\n\"It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn't, I think will be telling you porky pies.\"\nGreat Britain's team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women's side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series\nAfter a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter.\nThe tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead.\n\"We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"It just never seemed to end.\"\nThe captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle.\n\"When the final whistle went,\" McIntosh says, \"I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won?\n\"We didn't realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: 'We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great.'\"\nLisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame\nThe Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. \"We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,\" McIntosh says.\nBut off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women's rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England's head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002.\n\"The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,\" Sheldon says. \"GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002.\n\"You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period.\n\"It's physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women's game, so you've got breadth and depth of players coming through. It's an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia.\"\nBelatedly, Great Britain's 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport's female pioneers.\nIn 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nLast October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted.\n\"I think it's sad that it took so long, but I think it's fantastic that we're in a different place now,\" Carter says.\nOctober's ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together.\n\"There was a camaraderie that was built in '96,\" Carter says. \"We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we'd never been away from each other.\"\nGreat Britain's players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts.\n\"I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,\" McIntosh says. \"Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me.\"\nBut there's one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find.\nGreat Britain's team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing\nBritain's players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series.\nIn that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield.\nThree years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn't turned up.\n\"We thought we'd brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,\" McIntosh says. \"But it's not.\"\nThe mystery remains unresolved. \"Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,\" Sheldon says. \"I've got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield.\"\nIf anyone does have it, they're sitting on a piece of history. \n\"It's in somebody's attic, because I can't see where else it would have gone,\" Carter says. \"So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!\"",

        "article_text": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us \u2013 but what does AI see in them?\nFor more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality.\nEven if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.\nFor decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.\nYou might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.\nWhile many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations.\n\"When a person interprets a\u00a0Rorschach\u00a0image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\"\nFinding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity.\nBut what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?\nRecent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities.\nWe gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data \u2013 information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so.\nAI v the Mind\nThis article is part of\u202fAI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out.\u00a0\nShowing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be.\n\"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\"\nPretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\"\nThe chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image \u2013 a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched \u2013 perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\"\n\"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.)\u00a0\n\"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.\n\"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking \u2013 instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\"\nWhat we get is a facsimile of reality \u2013 and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says.\nGhosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users \u2013 which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption \u2013 but it can muddy the waters around how they \u2013 and their outputs \u2013 are perceived.\nOne way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation.\nWhen we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses.\n\"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\"\nThat's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered.\nThis is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" \u2013 named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates \u2013 on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted.\nIt is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.\nBut what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker \u2013 in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had \u2013 or created \u2013 a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\"\nWhile this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm \u2013 a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.)\nAI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\"\nAnd that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Friedrich Merz's conservatives have won, but Germany's 2025 election has thrown up some important and fascinating stories that reveal a country in flux.\nAlternative for Germany, or AfD, has doubled its support in just four years to 20.8%, and has spread out from its support base in the east to become the second biggest political force in parliament.\nMeanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD had its worst performance in decades, only securing 16.4% of the vote.\nHere are five key takeaways.\nLook at an election results map of Germany, and you could almost have travelled back in time to the Cold War, when an iron curtain divided communist East Germany from the west.\nIn the east it's a swathe of AfD light blue, apart from pockets like Berlin and half of Leipzig. In the west the vast majority has turned conservative black, especially in Bavaria where Merz's conservative sister party, the CSU, dominates the landscape.\nBut the AfD is spreading in the west too, and political loyalty to the old mainstream parties has gone. \nFor one in five Germans it has become normalised. \"They're just normal people,\" said one young man of immigrant origin in Duisburg, a city in western Germany's old industrial heartland.\nEven though it came second, the AfD is blocked from being part of the next government because of a \"firewall\" - or Brandmauer - operated by Germany's main parties, who do not co-operate with any party seen as extremist since the end of World War Two.\nThe AfD's leader Alice Weidel insists it is a libertarian, conservative movement, not racist. Its big increase in public support has coincided with a series of deadly attacks in the past nine months, all allegedly by immigrants.\nThe AfD has embraced a highly controversial policy called \"remigration\", which it defines as deporting migrants who have committed crimes. But the term can also refer to the mass deportation of migrants and their descendants.\nIn May 2024 a German court rejected an AfD appeal against a ruling classifying it as a suspected far-right extremist organisation. Judges found that the AfD had \"positions that disparage the democratic order and are incompatible with the principle of democracy\".\nIn three German states in the east - Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony - domestic intelligence has designated the AfD as right-wing extremist.\nA leading AfD figure in Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has twice been convicted of using a banned Nazi slogan \"Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland\" - everything for Germany. Alice Weidel supporters have chanted her name during the election campaign, using the phrase \"Alice f\u00fcr Deutschland\".\nNot since 1987 has turnout been as high as 82.5% in a German election, and that was three years before reunification of east and west.\nFour years ago it was 76.6%.\nPut simply, more than four in every five of Germany's 59.2 million voters turned out. \nIt reflects just how energised Germans have been by this election, which comes at a pivotal moment for their country. There were nine TV debates in the final stretch of the campaign, but that reflected the broad interest of the audience.\nThe three-party government of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz fell apart at the end of last year, and within 24 hours of Sunday's election, all three leaders have said they're leaving the front line of politics.\nThe leader of the economic liberals, the FDP, was first. Christian Lindner has led his party for 11 years. But it failed to get any MPs elected and Lindner has said he's leaving politics after 25 years. \nIt was Lindner's refusal to compromise on debt rules that first brought the government down, and then sent his party into the wilderness.\nAlthough Scholz will remain as chancellor until the next government is formed, he won't be taking part in coalition talks and will be leaving frontline politics.\nGreens Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck is also leaving frontline politics after his party fell below 12% in the election.\nUntil a few weeks ago, the Left party looked doomed when one of its leading lights, Sahra Wagenknecht, went off and founded her own, more populist, party with eight other MPs.\nWagenknecht's popularity soared for a while as head of her BSW party, but ultimately fell just below the 5% threshold for getting into parliament.  \nThe story was very different for the Left (Die Linke), which came back from the dead with an inspired social medial campaign.\nHeidi Reichinnek, Die Linke's co-chair, went viral after she gave a speech enthusiastically defending the firewall against the AfD. \nShe now has 580,000 followers on TikTok and her post has attracted seven million views.\nHer party secured just under 9% of the vote.\nDie Linke's viral videos helped secure a quarter of the 18-24 vote, and the AfD were not far behind with 21%, according to surveys by ARD TV.\nAlice Weidel was the biggest hit on social media during the election, even bigger than Heidi Reichinnek. She has attracted more than 935,000 followers on TikTok.\nFor the over-35s, it was the Christian Democrats who won out, and more men than women.",

Almost all of the cases - 101 - were in patients aged 17 and younger.\nThe US declared that measles had been \"eliminated\" in 2000, but the country has seen outbreaks in recent years amid a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. The last US measles death was in 2015, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\nThe current outbreak is centred in north-west Texas, with measles also recently found across the state's border in New Mexico, as well as Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New York City and Rhode Island, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nCurrently, there are nine cases reported in New Mexico, four of whom are children.\nKennedy, a vaccine sceptic in the past, said that measles outbreaks were common and there have been four measles outbreaks so far in the US this year. The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more related cases.\nHe also said his department was monitoring the current outbreak closely.\nA measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death.\nSurvivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).\nThere were 285 cases of measles reported in the US for all of last year, the highest number since 1,274 in 2019.\nSo far, 18 people in the current outbreak have had to go to hospital, according to the Texas health department. Kennedy said altogether 20 people were in hospital to quarantine.\nFive people in Texas who were infected had been vaccinated, the department also said. \nNew Mexico's congressional delegation has pushed Kennedy to urgently address the current outbreak, urging him to \"launch a vaccination promotion campaign\" and rehire recently fired federal health workers, among other measures,  in a letter on Monday.\n\"Just last Friday, two dozen employees at the CDC charged with training public laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts were fired,\" the state's two senators and three House members, all Democrats, wrote. \n\"Those firings will worsen outbreaks and ultimately threaten the health of all Americans in the face of the next public health emergency.\" \nMeanwhile, areas affected by the outbreak are hosting free vaccination clinics, with the city of Lubbock, where the child victim died, holding hours-long clinics each day this week.\nThe Texas outbreak is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, and local media.\nMost US children receive two immunisation shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the CDC.\nVaccination rates in Texas are 94.3%, according to the CDC, which is below the 95% level that the Infectious Diseases Society of America says is needed to also protect those who are not immunized, commonly called \"herd immunity\".\n\"Measles was rare in the United States, but outbreaks are occurring in areas where vaccination rates have fallen,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement. \"Most children who get measles are not up to date on recommended vaccines or are not old enough to get measles vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Kyiv and Washington are close to signing a deal over US access to Ukraine's mineral deposits, a Ukrainian minister says.\nOlga Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said on X that \"negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalised\". \nShe added that \"we are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature\".\nUkraine has been facing growing pressure from the US administration to sign the deal, which has ended up in the centre of the growing rift between the US and Ukrainian presidents.\nZelensky first included the offer of an agreement on minerals in the so-called \"victory plan\" that he presented to Trump last September.\nThe idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.\nGraphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nOn Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\". \nPrior to Stefanishyna's assertion that a deal was close, there appeared to be several sticking points.\nLast Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a reported 50% share of its rare earth minerals - which Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.\n\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.\nThe provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.\nInstead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.\nTrump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.\nHowever, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.\nZelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".\nHe rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\" but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to offering the US access to Russia's rare minerals, in order to counter a potential deal between the US and Ukraine.\nIn a televised interview on Russian state-owned broadcaster Rossiya 1, he said it would include access to Russia's \"new territories\" - those it has seized and occupied in Ukraine since their invasion three years ago.\n\"We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine,\" Putin said, adding Russia was ready to \"attract foreign partners\".",

        "article_text": "Mohamed Salah has lost two Afcon finals with Egypt \nWho would have thought a discussion on the brilliance of Mohamed Salah would spark a heated social-media row about the merits of the Africa Cup of Nations?\nWell that's what happened when Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\".\nSo what did Carragher say? Who else has spoken out? And is Afcon disrespected by a European-centric view of world football?\nBBC Sport attempts to break down and explain the issues.\nSpeaking after Liverpool's 2-0 Premier League win at Manchester City on Sunday, pundits in the Sky Sports studio were discussing Salah's performance and whether this season could be one of the \"greatest\" individual campaigns.\nBBC Sport explored that discussion on Monday.\nThe debate then turned to whether Salah could be in line to win the Ballon d'Or - a prestigious annual award for the best player in the world.\nThe Ballon d'Or is voted for by 100 journalists from around the world, and was won last year by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.\nFormer Liverpool defender Carragher suggested Salah would have to win the Champions League in order to win the Ballon d'Or because Afcon is not recognised by voters as a \"major tournament\".\nHe added: \"I think the problem is the fact he's with Egypt, and he's probably not playing in the major tournament as such, or maybe got a great chance of winning, I think it's either the Champions League or the major tournament. Normally, the player who excels in that.\"\nCarragher's repeated use of the term \"major tournament\" irked fellow pundits Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge. \nRichards stressed Afcon was a \"major tournament\", saying: \"A lot of people are at home saying 'They aren't taking it seriously.' Afcon is a big tournament.\"\nFormer Liverpool striker Sturridge said: \"It's a fact. If you win the Euros or Copa America it's deemed to be big - so the Afcon is at the same level.\"\nCarragher responded: \"Egypt are not going to win the World Cup are they?\" And when Richards tried to explain, he cut him off and said \"Oh God.\"\nClips of the exchange were shared widely across social media.\nOn Monday, Carragher attempted to clarify his comments on X, saying Salah was \"at a disadvantage playing for Egypt in terms of him winning the Ballon d'Or\".\n\"If Salah had an average season at LFC but won the Afcon & was MVP [Most Valuable Player] I don't think he would win the Ballon d'Or. Because I don't think Afcon carries the weight of other tournaments.\n\"But if Mbappe had an average season at Real Madrid but won the World Cup/Euros, he would still have a great opportunity.\"\nIs Salah set for greatest individual Premier League season?\nClub versus country dilemma for Afcon players\nEverything you need to know about Afcon 2023\nCarragher's comments drew criticism from a number of former players. \nWriting on X, former Aston Villa and Egypt captain Ahmed Elmohamady said: \"Jamie Carragher doesn't know what major tournaments [are] because he never won one. Afcon is a major tournament. So proud to [have] won it twice.\"\nFormer Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on his podcast that while he understood Carragher's point about the weight of Afcon on Ballon d'Or voting, he thought the comment was \"an ignorant thought process\" and Afcon should be \"respected more than it is\".\nCarragher - replying on Ferdinand's Instagram account - called his former England team-mate a \"clown\" and suggested he was \"playing to the gallery\".\nAfcon is held every two years and has typically been staged during European winter time.\nNo African nation has ever won the World Cup, and only one - Morocco at Qatar 2022 - has reached the semi-finals.\nIn a comparison of the wealth of the federations, Ivory Coast won $7m (\u00a35.5m) for winning Afcon 2023, Argentina won $42m (\u00a333.3m) for winning the last World Cup, and Spain won approximately 28m euros (\u00a323.4m) for winning Euro 2024.\nFormer AC Milan and Liberia striker George Weah is the only African player to have won the Ballon d'Or - having done so in 1995. \nSenegal and former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane - in 2022 - is the only African player to have finished in the top three in the voting in the 21st century. \nThe highest Salah has finished is fifth - in 2019 and 2022.\nIn 2021, former Arsenal and England player Ian Wright said some media coverage of Afcon was \"tinged with racism\", asking \"Is there ever a tournament more disrespected than the Africa Cup of Nations?\"\nTo get an idea of the value of Afcon, all you have to do is listen to some of the continent's greatest ever players. Legends such as Samuel Eto'o, Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba - or the big stars still in action, like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez.\nThey have trophy cabinets full of medals and titles from European club football, but Afcon means everything to them.\nComparisons will always be made to the quality of the Euros and the Copa America, but - just like those tournaments - it's incredibly difficult to win the trophy for even the biggest names and biggest countries.\nI've lost count of the amount of times the tournament favourites have crumbled under the pressure, or in tough conditions against so-called smaller football nations.\nDrogba never won it despite playing in a golden generation of Ivory Coast talent. Salah is yet to lift the trophy, and I can still picture how devastated he was after losing the finals in 2017 and 2021.\nThe organisers also argue the interest in the tournament around the world is increasing all the time. And having been in Ivory Coast at the last edition, I feel that too.\nIt was one of the most exciting I've experienced with the dramatic storyline of the hosts sacking their manager in the group stage before making a remarkable comeback and winning the final. On the ground it certainly felt that it was bigger than ever before with more worldwide interest than ever before.\nYes, there have been many issues in the past that have damaged the reputation of the tournament. For example late changes to the location, such as when Egypt hosted in 2019 instead of Cameroon, who weren't ready. Or changes to the timing, for example with the next edition which was due to take place in June and July but will now start just before Christmas.\nThen there are difficulties with infrastructure, security or organisation. But similar issues have also impacted the Euros and the Copa America in recent years.\nI've always found complaints about the tournament taking place in the middle of the European season overblown. Yes it's frustrating for the clubs but why should African football be dictated to by the European game? Weather conditions also make hosting it in June and July impossible in certain areas of the continent.\nThe tournament may not get the respect it deserves in some parts of the world but after covering six Afcons I get the impression that's changing and that the next edition in Morocco, where football is booming right now, will be bigger than ever and may just have an impact on the Ballon d'Or voting.\nAfcon is being 'disrespected' - Wright\nClub World Cup dates 'disrespectful' to Africa\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Energy bills will rise by more than expected from April, following an announcement from the regulator Ofgem.\nBut Labour pledged in its manifesto: \"We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good.\" It also promised bills would come down by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\". \nResponding to the price cap rise, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was due to \"our reliance on the fossil fuel markets\" and added: \"We're acting to bring down bills for everyone with our mission for clean, home-grown power that we control.\"\nThe government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030. \nMore power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper electricity bills?\nThere are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays, and the way the electricity market is set up.\nThe UK's electricity is expensive.\nCompared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.\nThis is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.\nFor industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period. \nThe UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.\nThe largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the \"wholesale\" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.\nOther parts of the bill include \"network\" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and \"policy\" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.\nThe main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.\nThe price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.\nOnce built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.\nGas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a \"carbon price\" - a charge for emissions.\nThe wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.\nIn Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.\n\"The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,\" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.\nRenewables can generate electricity cheaply.\nBut building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.\nThe government needs to triple wind and solar capacity and to get developers to build this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.\nIt does this by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity they generate for 15 years into the future.\nIf the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company; if the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.\nAny costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.\nStrike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.\nAs more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.\n\"There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,\" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.\n\"The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.\"\nThe UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.\nThis adds to the network costs in a bill.\nIntermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.\nGreat Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.\nSome analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.\nThe government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear. \nIn the long term, renewables \"will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,\" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.\nBut savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly. \nSome analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive \"strike prices\", locking in higher costs.\n\"If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further\u2026 but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],\" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.\n\"That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.\"\nBut a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.\nThe government said earlier in February that its plans would \"bring down bills for households and businesses for good\" and lowering them by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\" remains an objective.\nAdditional reporting by Chris Jeavans and Becky Dale\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

The appointment of administrators relates only to the UK arm of its business.\n\"The economic headwinds which are affecting companies right across the creative industries have proved too challenging to overcome, which has led to Technicolor's UK business being placed into administration today,\" the firm's joint administrator Nick Holloway said.\nTechnicolor was founded in 1915 and worked on its first film in 1917. In its early days it worked on projects with major studios including Disney.\nIt subsequently acquired major VFX studios including The Mill, which won an Oscar in 2001 for its work on Gladiator, and MPC, which recently delivered big budget remakes of Disney's The Lion King and Jungle Book.\nRecent projects include \"Kraven the Hunter,\" \"Young Woman and the Sea\" and \"Emilia Perez\" according to Variety.\nMikros Animation projects include two recent Mutant Ninja Turtles titles and the Paw Patrol series of films.\nVisual effects studios play a key role in film production. \nMost modern big-budget movies and television shows will rely heavily on visual effects to transport actors and audiences into outer space, the distant past or the deep sea.\nAnd the appearance and non-vocal performances of characters and creatures, fantastic and otherwise will often be partly or fully the creation of animators and other specialist staff.\nAs well as purely animated films and TV, many live action releases are in large part the work of the employees of VFX studios.\nMany staff work film-to-film on fixed-term contracts, so redundancies may not reflect the total impact of the business' troubles on jobs.\nAccording to animation news publisher Cartoon Brew an email sent over the weekend by chief executive Caroline Parot said \"external headwinds\" had exacerbated problems caused by factors including post-covid recovery. \nShe also said the US writers' strike which led to a slow-down in demand for VFX work causing \"severe\" pressure on cashflow.\nThose same issues will add to the anxiety of staff and may fear re-entering what has been a relatively lean jobs market for VFX professionals.\n\"Render in peace\" one self-described 13-year veteran of The Mill wrote on Reddit - a reference to the computationally intense process of producing final, film grade images, a process known as rendering.",

Most modern big-budget movies and television shows will rely heavily on visual effects to transport actors and audiences into outer space, the distant past or the deep sea.And the appearance and non-vocal performances of characters and creatures, fantastic and otherwise will often be partly or fully the creation of animators and other specialist staff.As well as purely animated films and TV, many live action releases are in large part the work of the employees of VFX studios.Many staff work film-to-film on fixed-term contracts, so redundancies may not reflect the total impact of the business' troubles on jobs.According to animation news publisher Cartoon Brew an email sent over the weekend by chief executive Caroline Parot said \"external headwinds\" had exacerbated problems caused by factors including post-covid recovery. \"The economic headwinds which are affecting companies right across the creative industries have proved too challenging to overcome, which has led to Technicolor's UK business being placed into administration today,\" the firm's joint administrator Nick Holloway said.Technicolor was founded in 1915 and worked on its first film in 1917. In its early days it worked on projects with major studios including Disney.It subsequently acquired major VFX studios including The Mill, which won an Oscar in 2001 for its work on Gladiator, and MPC, which recently delivered big budget remakes of Disney's The Lion King and Jungle Book.Recent projects include \"Kraven the Hunter,\" \"Young Woman and the Sea\" and \"Emilia Perez\" according to Variety.Mikros Animation projects include two recent Mutant Ninja Turtles titles and the Paw Patrol series of films.

She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes. \n\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"\nThe fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges. \nCatherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks. \n\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.\n\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"\nShareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse. \nThey backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m.

        "article_text": "After the A Complete Unknown star's surprise SAG win, viral acceptance speech and attention-grabbing campaign, could he pip Adrien Brody to the post to win the coveted best actor prize?\nHe turned up to his premiere on an e-bike; crashed his own lookalikes contest; laughed at all the times he failed to win awards on Saturday Night Live; and on Valentine's Day he arrived in Berlin's sub-zero temperatures bare-shouldered, in a powder pink vest. Over the course of a few weeks and months, Academy Award nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has upended the idea of how awards honourees behave in order to secure votes. Could he still be rewarded with a best actor Oscar on 2 March?\nIt would be a major upset even for this extraordinary awards season if so, as the favourite for the prize, Adrien Brody, who plays a Holocaust survivor in Brady Corbet's The Brutalist, has won the Golden Globe, Bafta and Critics Choice Awards \u2013 all traditional harbingers of the Oscar. But then 29-year-old Chalamet took the SAG (Screen Actors Guild) prize for best actor on Sunday for his role playing a young Bob Dylan in James Mangold's biopic A Complete Unknown, accepting the award with an earnest speech that went viral.\nUntil that moment, he was at least winning the award for \"one of the most gonzo best actor campaigns in Oscar history\", as Variety describes it. Apart from the e-bike incident in London and poking fun at his \"loser\" awards face on Saturday Night Live, he chatted with Kendrick Lamar ahead of Lamar's performance at the Superbowl half-time show, and impressed on sports channel ESPN by making accurate college football predictions. (Some were moved to label him \"Lisan al-Gaib\" for this, in reference to the seer-like figure from Dune: Part Two, which along with A Complete Unknown, makes two best picture nominees in which Chalamet stars.)\n\"What I find most interesting is everyone's reaction to it,\" Variety's Chief Awards Editor, Clayton Davis, tells the BBC about Chalamet's campaign. \"It varies from, 'Oh my god, the guy is an artist and he's our generation's James Dean, our Marlon Brando,' to older people feeling like he's the epitome of Gen Z or TikTok.\"\nDavis believes that Chalamet's actions (not to mention the baby pink and acid green outfits, plus his celebrity partner Kylie Jenner's discreet support) mean that he is speaking directly to his peer group \u2013 and that can only benefit the Academy Awards. \"He's really speaking to Gen Z, and I would say, if anything, maybe he's going to be a great and needed lifeline to get Gen Z into the Oscars again, by consuming content differently,\" he says. \"And the Oscars have been trying to find a way to reach that TikTok generation that's going to care about a 100-year-old organisation.\"\u00a0\nWhat he has also done, Davis argues, is made an awards season campaign authentic for someone of his age.\n\"He's trying to redefine how it looks for someone like him, and I can appreciate that,\" he says. \"And as someone who likes to call themselves an Oscar historian, I'm used to the traditional. You go in, you kiss babies, shake a lot of people's hands, and you talk about your work. Taking your shirt off on the red carpet is different. And it may be jarring for a lot of people at first, and it may not work this time, but it doesn't mean that it won't work ever. When you're the first to do something, it always looks strange until it becomes the norm. We are in a transitional period in Hollywood across the board. Why wouldn't that also hit the Oscar campaign trail?\"\nThe actor's promotional appearances have impressed some Oscar watchers. A post on entertainment website Lainey Gossip praises Chalamet, describing his \"current Oscar campaign-non-campaign\" as \"one of the best, if not the best, of all time\u2026 if he gets it, he's doing to do it not by prescription, not by sucking up to the old people.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, in his SAG acceptance speech (which also went viral) Chalamet aligned himself with some of the most revered actors in cinema history, naming Marlon Brando and Daniel Day-Lewis as those he looked up to.\n\"I know the classiest thing would be to downplay the effort that went into this role and how much this means to me, but the truth is this was five years of my life,\" Chalamet said. \"I'm really in pursuit of greatness,\" he added. \"I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I'm inspired by the greats. I'm inspired by the greats here tonight\u2026 I want to be up there.\" He also called Bob Dylan \"a true American hero\" in the speech, and, a week earlier at the Berlin Film Festival, referred to him as \"the man, the myth, the legend\".\n\"I love how Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet isn't sugarcoating how badly he wants to win the Oscar during his SAG speech,\" wrote Buzzfeed's Spencer Althouse on X.\nBut the perception that the Oscar demographic is older and thus needs a certain style of wooing is rapidly shifting, Clayton Davis says. \"They also added 4,000 new members in the last decade. And a lot of them are young, they're diverse, they're from different backgrounds,\" he explains. \"The Oscars have changed. The old guard, you're never going to get them on board, although when you respect someone like Bob Dylan and recognise his contribution, that speaks to older Academy voters, and they can in turn respect him [Chalamet] as an artist.\n\"They already embraced the movie; in that it's nominated for eight Oscars. He introduced Bob Dylan to Gen Z, who probably had never heard of this guy before. So, I think you've got to admire at minimum that he is bridging the generational divide.\"\nChalamet may be the youngest ever best actor winner in SAG's three-decade history, but the SAG prize was also Chalamet's first ever major award. He was first Oscar-nominated in 2018 at the age of 22 for Luca Guadagnino's love story Call Me by Your Name, Bafta-nominated in 2019 for Felix Van Groeningen's addiction drama Beautiful Boy, and Golden Globe-nominated last year for Paul King's Wonka.\nBut although his filmography speaks of taste and versatility, there are some reasons why an Oscar win for him is still unlikely this year. \"Voting for the Oscars closed already,\" Davis points out. \"I was most confident that he would win the SAG partly because they tend to be more populist in their choices. What it means for the Oscar race now is harder to discern. Is it a 'too little, too late' mentality? I remember last year when Lily Gladstone won the SAG best actress the day before Oscar voting closed, and after I'd concluded that Emma Stone was going to win the Oscar. We all switched our predictions to Lily, and Emma Stone still ended up winning in the end.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why horror performances deserve more awards\n\u2022\u00a0The Brazilian film that could upset the Oscars\n\u2022\u00a0'Category fraud' is the latest Oscar scandal\u00a0\nNor are the statistics on Chalamet's side. No one who has won just the SAG best actor award has then gone on to win the Oscar. Male actors also tend to win their Academy Awards later in life \u2013 in an Oscar statistic probably not lost on either of them, Adrien Brody is still the youngest ever male best actor Oscar winner, for The Pianist in 2002 at the age of 29, the same age as Chalamet is now. (By contrast, the youngest ever best actress winner was aged 21 at the time.)\n\"I think that it's a barrier of entry for some people in terms of voting for him,\" Davis says. \"Some people feel like, 'We have time, Timmy's here. Timmy's very established.' If anything, at minimum this generation's Leonardo DiCaprio, right?\" he says. \"There is this sense of, 'We don't have to do it now.'\"\nThis may not be comforting to Chalamet, as DiCaprio was aged 41 when he finally got his best actor Oscar, on his fourth attempt, but Davis is prepared to predict that next year Chalamet will have another chance at the Oscar in a film he's starring in and producing: Marty Supreme, directed by Josh Safdie.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Timmy will be here probably next year\u2026 Marty Supreme sounds like it's going to be an amazing movie, even though we know nothing about it. He will probably do back-to-back nominations at minimum. And in a year when he played in the sequel to a sci-fi franchise and played Bob Dylan, that's a pretty killer resume for 2024,\" he says. \"And now in 2025, he's going to be sporting a moustache in a Safdie brother movie. I'm excited to see what he's going to continue to deliver.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",
